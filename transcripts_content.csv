506955,1,Suhasini Chandramouli,"Good afternoon, and welcome to the Apple Q1 Fiscal Year 2025 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Suhasini Chandramouli, Director of Investor Relations. Today's call is being recorded. Speaking first today are Apple CEO, Tim Cook, and he will be followed by CFO, Kevan Parekh. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook, including the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions on the company's business and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks."
506955,2,Tim Cook,"Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Before I talk about our results I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the devastating wildfires that impacted the Los Angeles area this month. From our retail teams to Apple TV+, Apple Music, Fitness Plus, Beats and more LA is home to many of our team members. Our thoughts are with everyone who is beginning the road to recovery. For our part, we are contributing to the relief efforts and we will continue to support our teams and the local community. Now turning to the quarter. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $124.3 billion for the December quarter, up 4% from a year ago, and an all-time record. EPS also set an all-time record of $2.40, 10% higher year-over-year. We achieved all-time revenue records across the majority of the countries and regions we track, including the Americas, Europe, Japan, and the rest of Asia Pacific. We also continue to see momentum in emerging markets, setting all-time revenue records in a number of markets, including Latin America, the Middle East, and South Asia, among others. In services, we achieved an all-time revenue record, and in the past year, we've seen nearly $100 billion in revenue from our services business. I'm also pleased to announce that we reached a new record for our installed base with over 2.35 billion active devices. In October, we released the first set of Apple Intelligence features in U.S. English for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and we rolled out more features and expanded to more countries in December. Now users can discover the benefits of these new features in the things they do every day. They can use writing tools to help find just the right words, create fun and unique images with Image Playground and Genmoji, handle daily tasks and seek out information with a more natural and conversational Siri, create movies of their memories with a simple prompt, and touch up their photos with clean up. We introduced visual intelligence with camera control to help users instantly learn about their surroundings. Users can also seamlessly access chat GPT across iOS, iPadOS and MacOS. And we were excited to recently begin our international expansion with Apple Intelligence now available in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the U.K. We're working hard to take Apple Intelligence even further. In April, we're bringing Apple Intelligence to more languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and simplified Chinese, as well as localized English to Singapore and India. And we'll continue to roll out more features in the future, including an even more capable Siri. Apple Intelligence builds on years of innovations we've made across hardware and software to transform how users experience our products. Apple Intelligence also empowers users by delivering personal context that's relevant to them. And importantly, Apple Intelligence is a breakthrough for privacy and AI with innovations like Private Cloud Compute, which extends the industry-leading security and privacy of Apple devices into the cloud. Apple Intelligence opens up an exciting new frontier and is already elevating experiences across iPhone, iPad, and Mac. We're going to keep investing in innovation and in transformative tools that help users in their everyday lives. Let me now turn to our results for the quarter, starting with iPhone. iPhone revenue came in at $69.1 billion, reaching all-time iPhone revenue records in dozens of markets and regions. Our iPhone 16 lineup takes the smartphone experience to the next level in so many ways, and Apple Intelligence is one of many reasons why customers are excited. With the A18 powered iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, users are getting a big boost in battery life and incredible camera experiences with camera control. Our amazingly powerful iPhone 16 Pro models go even further with larger-than-ever displays and a pro camera system so advanced it can turn moments into masterpieces. In Mac, revenue was $9 billion for the December quarter, 16% higher year-over-year, driven by significant excitement around the world for our latest Mac lineup. The Mac is more than just a powerful tool. It's a launchpad to enable users to bring their best ideas and boldest creations to life. And there are so many reasons to choose Mac, from the breathtaking performance of the M4 family of chips to the groundbreaking and growing capabilities of Apple Intelligence. Every product in the Mac lineup offers something extraordinary, whether that's the super portable MacBook Air, the powerhouse MacBook Pro, the world's best all-in-one iMac, or the small wonder that is the Mac Mini, which is not only stunningly capable, but is our first carbon neutral Mac. All of this is enabled by the unparalleled power of Apple Silicon. iPad revenue was $8.1 billion, up 15% from a year ago, driven by strong interest for our latest products. We love hearing from customers, who are discovering for the first time the versatility of iPad from the ultra-portal iPad Mini, built from the ground up for Apple intelligence, to the powerful M4 iPad Pro in a stunningly thin and light design. iPad is there for our users whenever they need it and wherever they go and we are pleased to see so much excitement and enthusiasm for our lineup. Wearables home and accessories revenue came in at $11.7 billion. With its most advanced display yet and a thinner more comfortable design, the all-new Apple Watch Series 10 is the perfect companion to help users pursue their health and fitness goals this year. From the powerful Vitals app to more customizable activity rings, users have an ever-increasing set of innovative health tools at their fingertips and watchOS 11. Health innovation has long been a focus for us, and we're committed to continuing to advance this work, because we know how much it matters to our users. We've introduced new hearing health features on AirPods Pro 2, and new sleep apnea notifications on Apple Watch are also helping users learn of a potentially serious condition that's thought to affect up to a billion people worldwide. During the quarter, we also brought Apple Vision Pro to even more countries, enabling more customers to discover the magic of spatial computing. Users are enjoying incredible immersive entertainment experiences and powerful new features and enhancements to Mac virtual display. Vision Pro is also supercharging the creative process and the incredibly talented director John M. Chu recently shared how its extraordinary capabilities helped him bring the movie Wicked to life. Turning to services, we set an all-time revenue record of $26.3 billion for the December quarter, growing 14% from a year ago. We set all-time records in the Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia-Pacific, and a December quarter record in Japan. Five years since launch, Apple TV+ continues to be home to incredible storytelling that viewers love. There's nothing quite like the anticipation that comes when a fan favorite returns, and we were thrilled to debut the second season of Severance earlier this month. We have so much in store for our subscribers this year with new shows like The Studio and Your Friends and Neighbors. And we can't wait for the premiere of Formula 1 starring Brad Pitt on June 27, which will take viewers inside the sport in a truly unprecedented way. We're excited that Apple TV+ continues to draw attention and accolades. To-date, Apple TV+ productions have earned more than 2,500 nominations and 538 wins. During the quarter, we were also excited to launch a new Find My Service that can help our users when they lose their luggage. For the first time, if you put an air tag in your suitcase, you'll be able to share its location information with many major airlines, so they can quickly track down your bags if they get lost. Turning to retail, our teams went above and beyond to help customers find the perfect gift throughout the holiday season. We also celebrated openings of new stores in China, Spain, and the U.S. and we were excited to announce plans to connect with even more customers this year by adding a fifth store in the UAE and bringing our online store to Saudi Arabia this summer. We can't wait to welcome customers to the first of several flagship store locations in Saudi Arabia that were opening beginning in 2026. I just had the chance to visit both countries last month, and I had a great time meeting with customers and team members. There's an incredible energy and passion for technology in these growing markets. Every day, I get deeply moving notes about the many ways our technology is enriching our users' lives. I recently got a note from a customer who put his watch on his father's wrist when he feared something was wrong with him. The watch alerted them that the father was an AFib and they were able to get him to the hospital for potentially life-saving treatment. Another user put his new watch on for the first time and within 15 minutes was notified of a low heart rate that led to a necessary pacemaker. And there are so many touching notes around the profound impact of our new hearing health feature like a recent user who told me it had changed her life, allowing her to take part in conversations with her children and grandchildren. These are the kind of stories that remind us of how profoundly important our work is, and it drives us to innovate each and every day. At Apple, the future is full of promise and potential. We're always searching across a world of possibilities, finding those places where we can do the most good and putting all of our energy and ingenuity into making something special. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin."
506955,3,Kevan Parekh,"Thanks Tim, and good afternoon everyone. I'm going to cover the results for the first quarter of our fiscal year. We are very pleased to report an all-time high for revenue with December quarter revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4% year-over-year. We achieved all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe, Japan, and rest of Asia Pacific and grew in the vast majority of markets we track. Products revenue was $98 billion, up 2% year-over-year, driven by growth from iPad and Mac. Thanks to our incredible customer satisfaction and strong loyalty, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and geographic segments and is now over 2.35 billion active devices. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $26.3 billion, up 14% year-over-year. We grew in every geographic segment and achieved all-time records in both developed and emerging markets. Company gross margin was 46.9% at the high-end of our guidance range and up 70 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by favorable mix. Products gross margin was 39.3%, up 300 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by favorable mix and leverage. Services gross margin was 75%, up 100 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by mix. Operating expenses of $15.4 billion landed at the midpoint of our guidance range and up 7% year-over-year. This strong business performance resulted in all-time records for both net income at $36.3 billion and diluted earnings per share of $2.40, up 10% year-over-year. Operating cash flow was also strong at $29.9 billion, which included the impact of the $11.9 billion we paid during the quarter in connection with the state aid decision. Now, I'm going to provide some more details for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $69.1 billion, roughly flat to the prior year. We grew in the majority of markets we track and reached all-time revenue records in several developed markets, including Canada, Western Europe, and Japan and in emerging markets like Latin America, the Middle East, and South Asia. The iPhone Active installed base grew to an all-time high in total in an average geographic segment. We also set an all-time record for upgraders. According to a recent survey from Kantar during the December quarter, iPhone was a top-selling model in the U.S., Urban China, India, the U.K., France, Australia, and Japan. We continue to see high levels of customer satisfaction in the U.S. at 96% as measured by 451 research. Mac generated $9 billion in revenue, up 16% year-over-year. We saw strength across our lineup from the new Mac Mini to the latest MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models. This incredible performance was broad-based with double-digit growth in every geographic segment. With our latest advances in Apple Silicon and our fastest neural engine ever, customers are able to take advantage of the full capabilities of AI and Mac. The Mac installed base reached an all-time high and we saw a double-digit growth for both upgraders and customers new to the Mac. Additionally, customer satisfaction in the U.S. was recently measured at 94%. iPad revenue was $8.1 billion, up 15% year-over-year, driven by the new iPad Mini and latest iPad Air. The iPad installed base reached another all-time high, and over half of the customers who purchased an iPad during the quarter were new to the product. Customer satisfaction was at 96% in the U.S. based on the latest reports from 451 Research. Wearable's home and accessories revenue was $11.7 billion, down 2% year-over-year. Customers are excited about the new AirPods 4 and the latest hearing health features in AirPods Pro 2. On watch, although we face a difficult compare against the watch Ultra 2 launch last year, the Apple Watch installed base reached a new all-time high, with over half of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. Customer satisfaction for watch in the U.S. was reported at 94%. Our services revenue reached an all-time high of $26.3 billion, up 14% year-over-year. Services continues to see strong momentum, and the growth of our installed base of active devices gives us great opportunities for the future. We also see increased customer engagement with our services offerings. Both transacting and paid accounts reached new all-time highs, with paid accounts growing double-digits year-over-year. Paid subscriptions also grew double-digits. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform. We remain focused on improving the breadth and quality of our services offerings, from new games on Apple Arcade to exciting new programming on Fitness Plus, and the continued expansion of features like Tap to Pay, now live in 20 markets. Turning to enterprise, we have seen businesses continue to expand their deployments of our products and services. Deutsche Bank launched its Mac as Choice program for the developers and also issued the latest MacBook Air as a standard computer for their entire mortgage lending division. And we're excited to see leading enterprises such as SAP leverage Apple Intelligence in the U.S., with features like writing tools, summarize, and priority notifications to enhance both their employee and customer experiences. We also see strong demand in our emerging markets. For example, Zomato, a leading food ordering and delivery company in India, has deployed 1,000 of Macs across their workforce to foster innovation. In Vision Pro continues to see more use cases in enterprise, with Cisco's new spatial meetings delivering a fully immersive video conferencing experience for remote collaboration and learning. Let me quickly summarize our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $141 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $1 billion in maturing debt and decreased commercial paper by $8 billion, resulting in $97 billion in total debt. Therefore, net cash at the end of the quarter was $45 billion. During the quarter, we returned over $30 billion to shareholders. This included $3.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and $23.3 billion through open market repurchases of 100 million Apple shares. As usual, we will provide an update to our capital return program when we report results for the March quarter. As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we're providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we're projecting today for the current quarter. As the dollar is strengthened significantly, we expect foreign exchange to be a headwind and to have a negative impact on revenue of about 2.5 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. Despite that headwind, we expect our March quarter total company revenue to grow low to mid-single-digits year-over-year. We expect services revenue to grow low-double-digits year-over-year. When you remove the negative impact of the foreign exchange headwinds I described earlier, the year-over-year growth rate would be comparable to that of the December quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 46.5% and 47.5%. We expect operating expenses to be between $15.1 billion and $15.3 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $300 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on February 13, 2025, to shareholders of record as of February 10, 2025. With that, let's open to call the questions."
506955,4,Suhasini Chandramouli,"Thank you, Kevin. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question please?"
506955,5,Operator,"Certainly, we will go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead."
506955,6,Erik Woodring,"Great guys, Thanks so much for taking my questions. Tim, in your prepared remarks, you had noted that iPhone 16 models are selling better in markets where Apple Intelligence is available? And I'm just wondering if you could double-click on that comment a bit and share any other details you believe could better help us understand how Apple Intelligence is really impacting iPhone demand and/or what features you find that users are using most often already? And then I just have a quick follow-up. Thank you."
506955,7,Tim Cook,"Yes, Eric. Hi, it's Tim. The -- we did see that the markets where we had rolled out Apple Intelligence, that the year-over-year performance on the iPhone 16 family was stronger than those where Apple Intelligence was not available. In terms of the features that people are using, they're using all of the ones that I'd referenced in my opening comments from writing tools to image playground and Genmoji to visual intelligence and more. And so we see all of those being used. The cleanup is another one that is popular and people love seeing that one demoed in the stores as well. We only had 2, 2.5 weeks or so during the December quarter of the second release of [18.2] (ph) and then only had the U.K. and the other English language countries for the 2.5 weeks. And so we've got just the early indications at the moment, but we were glad…"
506955,8,Erik Woodring,"Okay, that's really helpful."
506955,9,Tim Cook,Yes.
506955,10,Erik Woodring,"Okay, thank you for that, Tim. It's helpful. And then, you know, if we just touch on China, obviously, in the news fairly frequently, if we set aside China Macro, which I understand is still challenging, can you maybe talk about the headwinds that that Apple faces, whether that's, you know, shifting preferences for Western technology brands in favor of domestic vendors, or is this just a function of not necessarily having Apple intelligence available with the iPhone 16, which is, you know, not necessarily helping replacement cycles. Just maybe double clicking on, on what you think and what you're hearing in China as a regard as it relates to the iPhone. Thanks so much."
506955,11,Tim Cook,"Yes, sure. If you look at our greater China revenue for the quarter, we were down 11% year-over-year. And over half of the decline that we experienced was driven by change in channel inventory from the beginning to the end of the quarter. And of course on the Apple intelligence side we have not rolled out in China and as we just talked about we did see better results in the markets that we had rolled out in than markets we hadn't rolled out in. And of course, it's the most competitive market in the world. And so all of those things are true. In terms of the macro situation, there was a fiscal stimulus or subsidy announced in very recently in January that did not affect the December quarter. There were some provincial subsidies in the December quarter, but the national program was announced, I believe, on January 20. And it does cover the categories that we have products in from smartphones to tablets and PCs and smart watches up to a certain, a maximum price point. And so we do see fiscal stimulus occurring and we'll be glad to talk about what that looks like on the next call."
506955,12,Erik Woodring,"Great. Thanks so much, Tim. Good luck."
506955,13,Tim Cook,Thank you.
506955,14,Suhasini Chandramouli,"Thank you, Eric. Operator, can we have the next question, please?"
506955,15,Operator,Our next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius. Please go ahead.
506955,16,Ben Reitzes,"Hey, guys. Thanks a lot for the question. And, hey, Tim, I wanted to ask you who -- you knew this one was coming, but there's a perception that you're a big beneficiary of lower cost of compute and I was wondering if you could give your worldly perspective here on the DeepSeek situation and if you are going to, if you, if anything's happened to change your views in terms of a tailwind to margins and your ability to execute even due to the potential for cost to come down due to that development and probably what was going to happen anyway. But I'd love your perspective on that and then have a quick follow-up. Thanks."
506955,17,Tim Cook,"Sure. In general, I think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing. And that's what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well. As you know, we do things on the device, and we do things in the private cloud and which mimics from a architectural point of view the -- what happens on the device. And from a CapEx point of view, we've always taken a very prudent and deliberate approach to our expenditure and we continue to leverage a hybrid model, which I think continues to serve us well."
506955,18,Ben Reitzes,"Oh, great. All right. Thanks, Tim. And then, you know, just with regard to, you know, the iPhone trajectory, do you feel like, I guess, what is -- you obviously don't talk about new products and stuff like that, but do you feel that there's a lot of room for form factor innovation in the future? Or do you feel that the current lineup kind of it shows where you're going? I guess without pulling punches wondering if you, you thought you know in terms of the phone innovation if there's a lot more to come and you could see the kind of current market changing a bit over the next two to three years. Thanks."
506955,19,Tim Cook,"I think, Ben, I think there's a lot more to come and I could not feel more optimistic about our product pipeline. So I think there's a lot of innovation left on the smartphone."
506955,20,Ben Reitzes,"Thanks a lot, Tim."
506955,21,Tim Cook,"Yes, thank you."
506955,22,Suhasini Chandramouli,"Thank you, Ben. Operator, could we have the next question, please?"
506955,23,Operator,Our next question is from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
506955,24,Michael Ng,"Good afternoon. Thank you for the question. I have two as well. First, it was encouraging to hear about the record for iPhone upgraders, which I think is something you haven't said for about a year now. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you would attribute this upgrade strength to? Has Apple Intelligence played a role in helping upgrades in the markets that you've launched in? Thanks."
506955,25,Tim Cook,"Yes, thank you for the question. If you look at iPhone, we did set an all-time record for upgraders, so we've never seen a higher level of upgraders before. The installed base hit a new all-time high as well. And if you look at the 16, compared to the 15 from launch, which occurred, as you know, in September, so this is across now two quarters from September to the end of the December fiscal quarter, the 16 outperformed the 15. And so I think you can conclude from that, that there are compelling reasons to upgrade. And in the markets where we had launched Apple Intelligence, they outperformed the markets that we did not. So lots…"
506955,26,Michael Ng,"Great, thank you, Tim. That's…"
506955,27,Tim Cook,"Yes, lots of good color there."
506955,28,Michael Ng,"Great, thank you, Tim. That's very clear. And then I had one about the iPad Pro and for the thinner version. I was just wondering if you could talk about that thin form factor for the iPad Pro. How did it help iPad sales overall and what did your kind of marketing consumer research tell you about how consumers valued that thin product form factor? Thank you."
506955,29,Tim Cook,It's a good question. iPad overall grew 15% for the quarter and it was more driven by iPad Air and the entry level iPad than it was the top level iPad. But overall we could not be more pleased with the iPad category growing 15%. It's a great achievement for the quarter. And probably what is most important is that over half of the sales in the December quarter went to customers who were new to the iPad. So that tells us that there's a good amount of customers there to attract.
506955,30,Michael Ng,"Thank you very much, Tim."
506955,31,Tim Cook,Yes. Thank you.
506955,32,Suhasini Chandramouli,"Thanks, Mike. Operator, could we have the next question, please?"
506955,33,Operator,Our next question is from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Please go ahead.
506955,34,Amit Daryanani,"Good afternoon, everyone. I have two as well. Maybe to start with, you folks are seeing some very robust growth trends in emerging markets right now for Apple products? Can you just add a high level, just talk about the durability of growth that you see in emerging markets? And then do you think the summation of these emerging markets are starting to get big enough or perhaps starting to grow fast enough that it can actually offset some of the China headwinds you're going through?"
506955,35,Tim Cook,"We have great results in a number of emerging markets. And as you know from past calls, I'm particularly keen on India. India set a December quarter record during the quarter. And we're opening more stores there. We've announced that we're going to open four new stores there. We also, the iPhone was the top selling model in India for the quarter. And it's the second largest smartphone market in the world and the third largest for PCs and tablets and so there's a huge market and we are -- we have very modest share in these markets. And so I think there's lots of upside there. And that's just one of the emerging markets."
506955,36,Kevan Parekh,"Yes, maybe I'll add, Amit, that in emerging markets we're also seeing double-digit growth on the install base, both in total and for the iPhone as well. So that's also an encouraging sign."
506955,37,Amit Daryanani,"Perfect. Thank you. And then, you know, just a question on gross margins for the March quarter. You folks are guiding gross margin is flattish on a sequential basis. Typically, I think it tends to be guided up a little bit, 50 basis points, so sequentially. Can we just touch on like, what are the offsets of the puts and takes you see here on gross margins? And Kevan, maybe you can just talked about its FX having an outsized impact in your margin profile as well in March?"
506955,38,Kevan Parekh,"Yes, Amit, let me take that One. You know, as we mentioned in my remarks, we're guiding to 46.5% to 47.5%. So we think it's, you know, we're very pleased with that level of guidance. As you mentioned, there's always puts and takes. We do think there's going to be some FX headwinds, which we talked about, that's going to affect, you know, our revenue growth as well. You know, it'll have an impact here on the margin, a sequential impact on margins. But we think that's going to be offset by favorable costs and the relative mix of services. We also, as you know, when we move from Q1 to Q2, especially on the product side, because Q1 is such a large quarter for a products business, we do have a loss of leverage. So there are some puts and takes, and I think we feel good about the range. We think it's a very, very strong guide for gross margin."
506955,39,Suhasini Chandramouli,"Thanks, Amit. Operator, could we get the next question, please?"
506955,40,Operator,Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
506955,41,Wamsi Mohan,"Yes, thank you so much. Tim, I want to follow-up on your comment about channel inventory in China. I was wondering if you could maybe address more broadly if channel inventory across your different product lines and regions? Do you feel they're elevated or out of range in any other regions? And given the clearing event that kind of happened in China, I guess in the quarter, should we think of a more normal progression quarter-on-quarter into the March quarter in China in particular, and I will follow."
506955,42,Tim Cook,"Yes, I don't want to project sales for the current quarter by region, but if you if you look at the channel inventory and look at iPhone in the aggregate, so on a worldwide basis we're very comfortable with our channel inventory position in the -- in China my point was that our channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter, and that was over half of the reduction in the reported results. And so if you look, part of the reason for that is that our sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to."
506955,43,Wamsi Mohan,"Okay, that's very clear. Thank you."
506955,44,Tim Cook,"Yes, thank you."
506955,45,Wamsi Mohan,"And then maybe as my follow-up, your services growth has been very strong and I know you've kind of been navigating some pretty challenging regulatory burdens on the business globally. So how should investors think about maybe either a top line or margin headwind that let's say you're currently absorbing in your results that could potentially maybe reverse in a more balanced regulatory environment? Thank you so much."
506955,46,Kevan Parekh,"Yes. So I think one, I just wanted to kind of reiterate the fact that, you know, our services business had an all-time record for December quarter of 14%. And that was a one strength that we saw across all geographic segments and also was very broad base across all of our services. So we have, as you know, a very broad services portfolio. And so we do see, you know, good momentum across the board. And as well, we continue to see increasing engagement across the customer base, across all of the service offerings, both transacting and paid accounts. We talked about reaching all-time highs, and we have over now 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services platform."
506955,47,Suhasini Chandramouli,"All right. Thanks, Wamsi. Operator, could we get the next question, please?"
506955,48,Operator,Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
506955,49,Samik Chatterjee,"Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess for the first one, if I -- I mean, you had a great quarter on Macs and iPads both. And I'm just curious, in terms of if you can help us think about the sustainability of this double-digit growth that you saw in both the product lines, and more interest are also here, we are talking about Apple Intelligence sort of influencing volumes on iPhones, but any thoughts on sort of how -- what does that influence look like in terms of volumes for Macs, for example, where I think there's a lot of conversation on AI PCs, how you're thinking about the impact there? And I have a quick follow-up. Thank you."
506955,50,Tim Cook,"Yes. If you look at Mac, Mac was up 16% and on iPad, we were up 15%. The Mac was driven by the very strong uptake on our new products during the quarter and the continued success of the MacBook Air. And so as you know, we've launched an M4-based MacBook Pro, an iMac and a Mac Mini during the quarter. We believe we've got the best AI PC out there for running workloads. The silicon in the Mac is, and it has been for several years now, designed by us and really designed for these workloads. And so I don't want to project at the category level for the future, but we're incredibly pleased with both the Mac and the iPad for the quarter."
506955,51,Samik Chatterjee,"Okay. And Tim, I'm going to use your earlier discussion about India as a strong emerging market to sort of ask you about the supply chain planning there in terms of how much of the supply chain planning there that you're doing is more of a reflection of the growth expectations from that market relative to in terms of diversification of the supply chain? And how should we sort of think about that strategy in terms of that particular country? Thank you."
506955,52,Tim Cook,"Yes. If you look at the manufacturing we do there, we do manufacturing both for the domestic market, and we export. And so in -- our business needs a certain economies of scale for it to make sense to manufacture in country. And so that really means that we're going to be both a use for the domestic market and an export market."
506955,53,Samik Chatterjee,Great. Thank you.
506955,54,Tim Cook,"Yes, thanks."
506955,55,Suhasini Chandramouli,"Thank you, Samik. Operator, could we get the next question, please?"
506955,56,Operator,Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.
506955,57,David Vogt,"Great, thanks, guys, for taking my question. So maybe, Tim, this is for you. I'm trying to think about your commentary around Apple Intelligence being sort of a momentum driver for the iPhone business. But when I think about your kind of framework for the March quarter, if I kind of adjust for channel inventory over the last couple of years, kind of, feels like your iPhone revenue for the March quarter is going to be relatively similar to the quarter two years ago and even the quarter last year? So how do we square kind of the momentum versus kind of the iPhone business effectively really kind of unchanged over the last couple of years? And then second, when I think about kind of the gross margin profile of the business, obviously, you've done a great job in taking gross margins up. Where do you think we sit in terms of, on the services side at least, where margins could go? It looks like the 75% margin has been incredibly successful quarter. But just trying to get a sense for where do you think this number could go over the intermediate term? Thank you."
506955,58,Tim Cook,"Yes. If you look at Apple Intelligence, what my point earlier was, that markets where we had rolled out Apple Intelligence during the Q1 period performed better on a year-over-year basis than markets where we had not. And so that gives us -- it's a positive indicator that we were pleased with. There are many compelling reasons to upgrade. And the other thing I would say, that I think I mentioned earlier, is that if you look at it from a launch to the end of the December quarter, and so that goes back to September, the 16 family is outperforming the 15 family. And so I think those are two good data points. Our next round of language rollouts will be in April. And so it will be at the -- in our Q3 quarter. And I'll let Kevan take the gross margin question."
506955,59,David Vogt,"Yes, great."
506955,60,Kevan Parekh,"Hi, David. How are you? So on the Services gross margin, I think maybe just stepping back a second. Services business in general in aggregate is accretive to the overall company margin. And one of the things, as an important reminder, is we've got a very broad services portfolio. And those businesses have very different margin profiles. And so I think, one, it's because of the nature of those businesses and in part also because of the way we account for them. And so one of the big factors that drive the Services gross margins and relative performance of those different businesses within the portfolio. We also have the dynamic of some scale businesses like payment services, iCloud, that are actually growing. And there, when we add incremental users, those end up being accretive to margins as well. And so in general, what we saw in the December quarter was nice momentum across our entire services business that allows us to deliver that 75% margin at the services level. And I think our guidance takes into consideration what we think we're going to land from a company standpoint of 46.5% to 47.5%, which again, we think is a strong guide."
506955,61,David Vogt,"Great, thanks, guys."
506955,62,Suhasini Chandramouli,"All right, thank you, David. Operator, could we have the next question, please?"
506955,63,Operator,Our next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
506955,64,Krish Sankar,"Yes, thanks for taking my question. I also had two of them. One, the first one for Tim. You had very strong Mac growth, 16% year-over-year last quarter. Just wondering how much of that was driven by some of the Mac silicon innovation versus a replacement cycle for Macs?"
506955,65,Tim Cook,"I don't know the answer to your question precisely, but I think it is a combination of these products are so compelling, the M4-based products are so compelling, that it's driving both upgrades at the double-digit level and it's driving switchers at a double-digit level. And so we're seeing both come out, and I think it's just because of the compelling products."
506955,66,Krish Sankar,"Got it. Got it. Thanks for that, Tim. And then a follow-up for Kevan on the gross margin. I want to ask you on the product side. Last quarter, you had 39.3%, which is very strong, similar to a year ago period. I'm kind of curious how much more levels do you have on the product side to improve the gross margin? Or do you think with some of the more new AI-related devices, there's more upside to gross margin from here on the product hardware side?"
506955,67,Kevan Parekh,"Yes. Thanks, Krish, for the question. So on the product side, as you mentioned, we had pretty strong sequential improvement, 300 basis points, for the December quarter. That was really driven by, we talked about, favorable mix and leverage. As you know, in Q1, again, it's a launch quarter for many products, and so we tend to benefit from the leverage that we get from that higher volume. I would say, in general, our gross margin on products is driven by a number of factors. One of them is the various product launches that we have. Different products do have different margin profiles. And so that mix does make a difference. And in particular, what we're seeing is, for example, many of our mix is across like phone, for example, we're seeing customers gravitate towards our Pro products because of things like affordability that allows our customers to get into our best products, which have favorable gross margins. So we're continuing to see that trend, that impacted us in the December quarter. As well, I think we're in a favorable commodity environment from a cost standpoint. And so we're benefiting from that as well in the December quarter. And then that's going to be, as we talked about, we're going to have a foreign exchange headwind heading into the March quarter, but we figured that's contemplated in the guidance range that we gave, the 46.5% to 47.5%."
506955,68,Krish Sankar,"Thanks, Kevan. Thanks, Tim."
506955,69,Suhasini Chandramouli,"Thank you, Krish. Operator, could we get the next question, please?"
506955,70,Operator,Our next question is from Richard Kramer with Arete Research. Please go ahead.
506955,71,Richard Kramer,"Thanks very much. My first question is for Tim. I'd like to ask about what might accelerate the pace of Apple Intelligence adoption. I guess do you see this simply as a question of time i.e., to launch more markets and languages or increase the percentage of installed base devices that can support it? Or is it a question of money, i.e., shifting R&D or marketing spend towards AI? And based on other prior Apple services, do you expect a sort of tipping point where adoption will go mainstream? Thanks."
506955,72,Tim Cook,"I do believe it will go mainstream. I'm getting feedback from people using different features today. And this is -- keep in mind that on the iPhone side of our business, you either have to have an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 16 to use Apple Intelligence. And so the -- as that base grows, I think the usage will continue to grow. And I think -- I know from my own personal experience, once you start using the features, you can't imagine not using them anymore. I know I get 100s of e-mails a day, and the summarization function is so important. So I think it's a combination of that. And of course, in April, we roll out a whole series of new languages that we had mentioned, and so the base grows further."
506955,73,Richard Kramer,"Okay, thank you. And then, Kevan, one of Luca's legacies was really getting Apple to record margin levels and also maintaining very consistent pricing across the product range. But taking the current high levels of profitability as fairly stable, what observations might you share about price sensitivity of users and whether having a wider range of pricing across the products might unlocks potentially further market share gains or boost overall product growth?"
506955,74,Kevan Parekh,"Yes, it's a good question. I think one, I don't think we're going to really depart from what served us pretty well to now. I mean we always take it into consideration, looking at short-term -- comparison between the short term and the long term. I think we've had a pretty disciplined pricing strategy, which would serve us pretty well. And I think we're going to continually kind of stick with that as far as I can tell."
506955,75,Richard Kramer,"Okay, thanks."
506955,76,Suhasini Chandramouli,"Thank you, Richard. Operator, could we get the next question, please?"
506955,77,Operator,Our next question is from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.
506955,78,Atif Malik,"Hi, thank you for taking my question. How do you guys see the potential tariff impact to your product for consumer demand under Trump 2.0 you guys did find under Trump 1.0?"
506955,79,Tim Cook,We are monitoring the situation and don't have anything more to add than that.
506955,80,Atif Malik,"Great. And Tim, as a follow-up, there is a lot of discussion on agentic AI, the use of agents. Do you guys see the upgraded series expected in April as something that will, let's say, be the killer application among the suite of features that you have announced in Apple Intelligence?"
506955,81,Tim Cook,"I think the killer feature is different for different people. But I think for most, they're going to find that they're going to use many of the features every day. And certainly, one of those is the -- is Siri, and that will be coming over the next several months."
506955,82,Atif Malik,Thank you.
506955,83,Suhasini Chandramouli,"All right. Thank you, Atif. Operator, could we please get the last question?"
506955,84,Operator,Our last question is from Ben Bollin from Cleveland Research Company. Please go ahead.
506955,85,Ben Bollin,"Good evening, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Tim, I'm interested in your thoughts and how you would have us think about the average useful life of these devices in the wild. And in particular, curious, if you look at the strength you saw in fiscal ‘21 and how that might support accelerated refresh opportunity into the future?"
506955,86,Tim Cook,"Yes. Ben, I think it's different for different types of users. I mean you have very early adopter kind of users that are very quick to jump on the latest technology that upgrade very frequently. And then you have people that are on the entire opposite side of that barbell. And most people are between those two points. And so I do think there were lots of units that are sold during the COVID period of time, and it's a huge opportunity for us as a company to -- for more than one of the product categories."
506955,87,Ben Bollin,"That’s it from me. Thanks, Tim."
506955,88,Tim Cook,Thank you.
506955,89,Suhasini Chandramouli,"All right. Thanks, Ben. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks on Apple Podcasts or as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone. The number for the telephone replay is 866-583-1035. Please enter confirmation code 7398532 followed by the pound sign. These replays will be available by approximately 5 p.m. at Pacific Time today.

506955,90,Operator,"Once again, this does conclude today's conference. We do appreciate your participation."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,1,AI Insights,
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,2,Suhasini Chandramouli,"Good afternoon, and welcome to the Apple Q2 Fiscal Year 2025 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Suhasini Chandramouli, Director of Investor Relations. Today's call is being recorded. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook; and he'll be followed by CFO, Kevan Parekh. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook, including the potential impact of tariffs and other trade measures and macroeconomic conditions on the company's business and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Additional information will also be in our report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 29, 2025 to be filed tomorrow and in other reports and filings we make with the SEC. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,3,Tim Cook,"Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, we are reporting 95.4 billion in revenue, up 5% from a year ago and at the high end of the range we provided last quarter. Diluted EPS was $1.65, up 8% year-over-year and a March quarter record. Services achieved an all-time revenue record, growing 12% compared to the prior year. We also set a number of quarterly records in countries and regions across the world, including the UK, Spain, Finland, Brazil, Chile, Turkey, Poland, India, and the Philippines. We are as dedicated as ever to the innovation and ingenuity that will enrich our customers' lives and help us leave the world better than we found it. And we are proud to increase our impact around the world, including here in the United States, where we recently announced plans to spend $500 billion over the next four years. We're going to be expanding our teams in our facilities in several states, including Michigan, Texas, California, Arizona, Nevada, Iowa, Oregon, North Carolina, and Washington. And we're going to be opening a new factory for advanced server manufacturing in Texas. During calendar year 2025, we expect to source more than 19 billion chips from a dozen states, including tens of millions of advanced chips being made in Arizona this year. We also source glass used in iPhone from an American company. All told, we have more than 9,000 suppliers in the U.S. across all 50 states. Now I'll turn to products, starting with iPhone. iPhone revenue was $46.8 billion, up 2% from a year ago. During the quarter, we introduced iPhone 16e, a great new entry-level addition to our iPhone 16 lineup. It's powered by our latest generation A18 chip and includes the all-new Apple-designed C1 modem, the most energy-efficient modem ever in an iPhone, allowing iPhone 16e to have the longest battery life of any 6.1-inch iPhone. Meanwhile, iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus users are exploring how they can use Camera Control, whether capturing stunning images or exploring the world with Visual Intelligence. And our iPhone 16 Pro models continue to be a hit with our users. They are turbocharged by the remarkable capabilities and efficiency of A18 Pro and feature larger displays, an advanced camera system and a beautiful design. Mac revenue was $7.9 billion, 7% higher year-over-year, another great quarter for Mac. During the quarter, we introduced significant new updates to our lineup. The world's most popular laptop just got even better. The M4-powered MacBook Air features a 12-megapixel Center Stage camera and delivers a massive boost in performance. And now it comes in a beautiful new sky blue color. The new Mac Studio is the most powerful Mac we've ever shipped, equipped with M4 Max and our new M3 Ultra chip. It's a true AI powerhouse capable of running large language models with over 600 billion parameters entirely in memory. Apple Intelligence brings great capabilities to the Mac with features like Writing Tools and Notification Summaries that help users stay focused and get more done. Turning to iPad. Revenue for the quarter was $6.4 billion, up 15% from a year ago, another strong quarter of double digit growth. Our iPad lineup continues to help users learn, work, play, and go wherever their imaginations take them. The new iPad Air with M3 combines powerful performance and exceptional portability, whether you're taking it across the street or around the world. And Apple Intelligence and Apple Pencil Pro are a perfect match, with features like the Clean Up Tool in Photos to remove distractions, and Image Wand in the Notes app to elevate simple sketches into polished illustrations. Across Wearables, Home and Accessories, revenue was $7.5 billion, down 5% from a year ago. From walking trails to bike paths, Apple Watch Series 10 is an essential partner wherever you are on the health and fitness journey. And AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation delivers an extraordinary experience in an open-ear design. Customers continue to tell me how important our Hearing Health features for AirPods Pro 2 are to them, and we've been expanding their availability to reach even more users around the world. Millions have already taken hearing tests and the stories we received about the new hearing aid feature are deeply moving, showing how these innovations are making a real difference in people's daily lives. It's a powerful reminder of the impact technology can have when it's designed with care. Meanwhile, Apple Vision Pro takes the concert experience to a whole new level with Metallica, our latest Apple immersive video, which you have to see to believe. And visionOS 2.4 unlocks the first set of Apple Intelligence features for Vision Pro users while inviting them to explore a curated and regularly updated collection of spatial experiences with the Spatial Gallery app. In retail, in addition to the two stores we opened during the quarter, we're also looking forward to a new retail store in the UAE, the arrival of the online store in Saudi Arabia and new retail stores in India starting later this year. Let's now turn to Services, where we achieved an all-time revenue record of $26.6 billion, up 12% from a year ago with strong performance across all of our categories. From starting their morning with their podcast of choice to buying a coffee with Apple Pay to spending an afternoon reading the latest bestseller on Apple Books to using their favorite app from the App Store or an evening workout with Fitness+, Apple Services are enriching our users' lives all throughout their day. With incredible shows like The Studio, Your Friends & Neighbors and the culture-shaping Severance, Apple TV+ has become a must-see destination with record viewership during the quarter. And we're excited for our upcoming movie F1 starring Brad Pitt, which will hit theaters this summer and gives an incredible inside look at one of the most intense sports on Earth. And there is so much more to come this year. It's no wonder Apple TV+ has earned more than 2,500 award nominations and 560 wins. We're also reaching sports fans in more ways than ever, from watching our favorite teams go to bat on Friday Night Baseball to cheering on their local team with MLS Season Pass to following the results of every Grand Prix with Formula 1 now on the Apple Sports app. Turning to software. We just released iOS 18.4, which brought Apple Intelligence to more languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and simplified Chinese as well as localized English to Singapore and India. AI and machine learning are core to so many profound features we've rolled out over the years to help our users live a better day. It's why we designed Apple Silicon with a neural engine that powers so many AI features across our products and third-party apps. It's also what makes Apple products the best devices for generative AI. At WWDC 24, we announced Apple Intelligence and shared our vision for integrating generative AI across our ecosystem into the apps and features our users rely on every day. To achieve this goal, we built our own highly capable foundation models that are specialized for everyday tasks. We designed helpful features that are right where our users need them and are easy to use. And we went to great lengths to build a system that protects user privacy, whether requests are processed on-device or in the cloud with Private Cloud Compute, an extraordinary step forward for privacy and AI. Since we launched iOS 18, we've released a number of Apple Intelligence features from helpful Writing Tools to Genmoji, Image Playground, Image Wand, Clean Up, Visual Intelligence and a seamless connection to ChatGPT, we made it possible for users to create movies of their memories with a simple prompt and added AI-powered photo search, smart replies, priority notifications, summaries for mail, messages and more. We've also expanded these capabilities to more languages and regions. With regard to the more personal Siri features we announced, we need more time to complete our work on these features so they meet our high-quality bar. We are making progress and we look forward to getting these features into customers' hands. Turning to sustainability. We just celebrated Earth Day, and we were proud to announce that we've cut our emissions by 60% from our 2015 levels. Today, we're using more clean energy across our operations and more recycled materials in our products than ever. We have worked with suppliers to bring 17.8 gigawatts of renewable electricity online. We're also saving billions of gallons of freshwater and redirecting millions of metric tons of waste from landfills. All of this will help us make important progress towards our goal of carbon neutrality across our supply chain and the life cycle of our products by 2030. Now let me walk you through the impacts of tariffs in the March quarter and give you some color on what we expect for the June quarter. For the March quarter, we had a limited impact from tariffs as we were able to optimize our supply chain and inventory. For the June quarter, currently, we are not able to precisely estimate the impact of tariffs as we are uncertain of potential future actions prior to the end of the quarter. However, for some color, assuming the current global tariff rates, policies and applications do not change for the balance of the quarter and no new tariffs are added, we estimate the impact to add $900 million to our costs. This estimate should not be used to make projections for future quarters as there are certain unique factors that benefit the June quarter. For our part, we will manage the company the way we always have, with thoughtful and deliberate decisions, with a focus on investing for the long term, and with dedication to innovation and the possibilities it creates. As we look ahead, we remain confident, confident that we will continue to build the world's best products and services, confident in our ability to innovate and enrich our users' lives, and confident that we can continue to run our business in a way that has always set Apple apart. Next month, we can't wait to welcome our developer community for the Worldwide Developers Conference, and we look forward to revealing some exciting announcements. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevan."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,4,Kevan Parekh,"Thanks, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Our March quarter revenue of $95.4 billion was up 5% year-over-year despite a headwind of almost 2.5 percentage points from foreign exchange. We also grew in the majority of the markets we track. Products revenue was $68.7 billion, up 3% year-over-year, driven by growth in iPhone, iPad, and Mac. And thanks to our high levels of customer satisfaction and strong loyalty, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all product categories and geographic segments. Services revenue was $26.6 billion, up 12% year-over-year despite over 2 percentage points of foreign exchange headwinds. And as Tim mentioned, this was an all-time revenue record. We also grew in every geographic segment and saw double-digit growth in both developed and emerging markets. Company gross margin was 47.1%, in the middle of our guidance range and up 20 basis points sequentially primarily driven by favorable mix. Products gross margin was 35.9%, down 340 basis points sequentially, driven by mix, foreign exchange and a seasonal loss of leverage. Services gross margin was 75.7%, up 70 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by a different mix, partly offset by foreign exchange. Operating expenses landed at $15.3 billion, up 6% year-over-year. Net income was $24.8 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.65, up 8% year-over-year and a March quarter record. Operating cash flow was also strong at $24 billion. Now I'm going to provide some more details for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $46.8 billion, up 2% year- over-year driven by the iPhone 16 family. The iPhone Active installed base grew to an all-time high in total and in every geographic segment, and iPhone upgraders grew double-digits year-over-year. According to a recent survey from Kantar, during the March quarter, iPhone was a top-selling model in the U.S., urban China, the UK, Germany, Australia, and Japan. And we continue to see high levels of customer satisfaction in the U.S. at 97% as measured by 451 Research. Mac revenue was $7.9 billion, up 7% year-over-year, driven by the latest MacBook Air, MacBook Pro and Mac Mini models. This performance was broad-based with every geographic segment growing year-over-year. Mac installed base reached an all-time high and we saw strong growth for both upgraders and customers new to the Mac. Customer satisfaction was reported at 95% in the U.S. iPad revenue was $6.4 billion, up 15% year-over-year, driven by the new M3-powered iPad Air. The iPad installed base reached another all-time high, and over half the customers who purchased an iPad during the quarter were new to the product. Based on the latest reports from 451 Research, customer satisfaction was 97% in the U.S. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $7.5 billion, down 5% year-over-year. Keep in mind, we did face a more difficult compare against the launch of the Apple Vision Pro in the year ago quarter as well as the Watch Ultra 2 launched last year. At the same time, the Apple Watch installed base reached a new all-time high with over half of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. And customer satisfaction for Watch in the U.S. was recently measured at 95%. Our Services revenue reached an all-time high of $26.6 billion, up 12% year-over-year. This growth rate was comparable to the December quarter year-over-year growth rate when we removed the negative impact from foreign exchange. We saw strong momentum in the March quarter and the growth of our installed base of active devices gives us great opportunities for the future. Customer engagement across our Services offerings also continue to grow. Both transacting and paid accounts reached new all-time highs, with paid accounts growing double-digits year-over-year. Paid subscriptions also grew double-digits. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform. We continue to improve the quality and breadth of our service offerings from additional features in News+ to new games available on Arcade. Apple Pay continues to help our customers with an easy, secure and private payment solution, and we were pleased to see that our active users in Apple Pay reached an all-time record, up double-digits year-over-year. Turning to enterprise. Organizations are investing more on Apple products and services to drive productivity and employee engagement. For example, KPMG recently rolled out iPhone 16 for all U.S. employees, reflecting their confidence in Apple's security and privacy features. We also continue to see strong Mac performance in enterprise. New Bank, the largest digital bank in Latin America has selected MacBook Air as a standard computer for their thousands of employees. With Vision Pro, companies are continuing to find new and innovative ways to leverage this technology. Dassault Systèmes, a leading provider for engineering and 3D design software has natively integrated Apple Vision Pro into their next-generation platform, bringing a powerful and immersive spatial experience to thousands of enterprise customers. Now let's turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $133 billion in cash and marketable securities. We had $3 billion in debt maturities and increased commercial paper by $4 billion, resulting in $98 billion in total debt. Therefore, at the end of the quarter, net cash was $35 billion. During the quarter, we returned $29 billion to shareholders. This included $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $25 billion through open market repurchases of 108 million Apple shares. Given the continued confidence we have in our business now and into the future, today, our Board authorized an additional $100 billion for share repurchases as we maintain our goal of getting to net cash neutral. We're also raising our dividend by 4% to $0.26 per share of common stock, and we continue to plan for annual increases in the dividend going forward as we have done for the last 13 years. This cash dividend will be payable on May 15, 2025, to shareholders of record as of May 12, 2025. As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to. Importantly, the color we're providing assumes that global tariff rates, policies and application remain in effect as of this call. And the global macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from today for the current quarter. Despite the overall uncertain environment, we will still be providing color at the total company level, subject to these assumptions and the risk factors that we referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect our June quarter total company revenue to grow low to mid-single digits year-over-year. We expect gross margin to be between 45.5% and 46.5%, which includes the estimated impact of the $900 million of tariff-related costs that Tim referred to earlier. We expect operating expenses to be between $15.3 billion and $15.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $300 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%. With that, let's open the call to questions."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,5,Suhasini Chandramouli,"We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?"
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,6,Operator,Certainly. We'll go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley.
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,7,Erik Woodring,"Great, thanks so much guys for taking my questions. Tim, I'd love to maybe touch on the tariff point first. There were comments from you earlier on CNBC talking about 50% of iPhones for the U.S. currently coming from India. Where do you expect the mix of India-sourced iPhones for the U.S. to be by the end of your fiscal year? And is it the goal to source 100% of your U.S.-bound iPhones from India? Can you just help us understand kind of how we should expect that to trend as we look beyond just the June quarter? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,8,Tim Cook,"Yes, Erik, hi. It's Tim. The existing tariffs that apply to Apple today are based on the product's country of origin as you alluded to. For the June quarter, we do expect the majority of iPhones sold in the U.S. will have India as their country of origin and Vietnam to be the country of origin for almost all iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and AirPods products sold in the -- also sold in the U.S. China would continue to be the country of origin for the vast majority of total product sales outside the U.S. And so if you look at the categories of tariffs that are applicable to us today, for the June quarter, most of our tariff exposure relates to the February IEEPA-related tariff at the rate of 20%, which applies to imports to the U.S. for products that have China as their country of origin. In addition, for China, there was an additional 125% tariff for imports of certain categories of products announced in April. And for us, that's some of our U.S. AppleCare and Accessories businesses and brings the total rate in China for these products to at least 145%. Also for transparency and clarity, the vast majority of our products, including iPhone, Mac, iPad, Apple Watch, and Vision Pro, are currently not subject to the global reciprocal tariffs that were announced in April as the Commerce Department has initiated a Section 232 investigation into imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment and downstream products that contain semiconductors. And so if you -- for the June quarter, as I talked about in the -- in my opening comments, we estimate the impact, assuming that the current global tariff, rates, policies and applications don't change for the balance of the quarter, to be 900 million to our costs. I wouldn't want to predict the mix of production in the future, but I wanted to give you clarity for the June quarter of where the country of origins are so you can use that for your modeling."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,9,Erik Woodring,"Okay. I appreciate that color. Thank, Tim. And then maybe my follow-up is there were a number of reports during the quarter that Apple had pulled forward sell-in into the channel to get ahead of tariffs. So can you just help us better kind of understand or clarify if sell-in and sell-through were aligned in the March quarter? If you're assuming that they would be aligned in the June quarter guide? And ultimately, do you believe that consumers are accelerating hardware purchases to get ahead of any potential pricing increases or was behavior normal? Thank you so much, Tim."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,10,Tim Cook,"Yes. Thanks, Erik, for the question. There are several questions there. One, in terms of the pull forward in demand, if you look at the March quarter, we don't believe that we saw obvious evidence of a significant pull forward in demand in the March quarter due to tariffs. If you look at our channel inventory, from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter, the unit channel inventory was similar, not only for iPhone but for the balance of our products. Again, for transparency, you will see that we did build ahead inventory, and that's reflected in our manufacturing purchase obligations that you'll see on the quarterly filing when it comes out. So I hope that makes the -- answers all your questions."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,11,Erik Woodring,"Thank you so much, Tim. Good Luck."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,12,Tim Cook,Thanks.
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,13,Suhasini Chandramouli,"Thank you, Eric. Operator, could we have the next question, please?"
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,14,Operator,Our next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius. Please go ahead.
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,15,Ben Reitzes,"Hi, thanks a lot. Tim, if you had told me that on April 2 that your hit from tariffs was only a nickel-ish a quarter at 900 million, that would have been a pretty good outcome, given the panic that ensued. I'm surprised that it's that low. But then you did make a comment about after the June quarter, and sorry to push you on that, but could it be a multiple of that figure or is it just completely unknown? We're all just trying to figure out what happens after June. And if there's just any guidance you guys can possibly give that it's bigger, smaller or what? And hoping you can just give us a little color on that. Thanks."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,16,Tim Cook,"Yes, Ben. Thanks for the question. I tried to give you some information in the previous question about the country of origin, which currently is the key factor in determining the tariffs that we're paying. I don't want to predict the future because I'm not sure what will happen with the tariffs, and there is the Section 232 investigation going on. And so it's very difficult to predict beyond June. And June has the assumptions in it that I had mentioned earlier."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,17,Ben Reitzes,"All right, Tim. And then just with regard to China down 2%, I mean, you intuitively would have thought there would have been an increased nationalism there and perhaps it would have been worse than that. And the trajectory there improving even with subsidies because subsidies benefited your competitors, too. Just wondering if I could get a little more color there. Can it keep improving? What are you thinking with regard to that trajectory in China, given all the geopolitical tensions? Thanks."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,18,Tim Cook,"Yes, we were down 2%, as you point out, for the March quarter. And to provide a little more transparency around that, we were roughly flat when you remove the headwinds from foreign exchange. And so we did see quite a bit of sequential improvement from the December quarter, which was down 11. And again, for going out of the way for transparency, the channel inventory at the end of March, the unit channel inventory was similar to where we started the quarter. So there wasn't a build of channel inventory in there. I do believe that the subsidies played a favorable impact on the results. It's difficult to estimate with precision as to exactly how much, but I think it was positive. Some of our products are included. Some of them are not. Generally, on iPhone, if something is priced above RMB6,000, it is not eligible for the subsidy and the other products have different rules. But I do think it helped. And I think it's helping others as well, I'm sure. iPhone was the key driver of the improvement sequentially. And so hopefully, that provides you some color. The other thing I would say is that the Mac, the iPad, and the Watch are attracting a majority of customers new to that product. And so that continues to look quite good in China. And iPhone was the top two models in urban China, and iPad was the top two tablets in urban China. So there's some positive nuggets there."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,19,Ben Reitzes,"Thanks a lot, Tim."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,20,Tim Cook,"Yes. Thank you, Ben."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,21,Suhasini Chandramouli,"Thank you, Ben. Operator, may we have the next question, please?"
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,22,Operator,Our next question is from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,23,Michael Ng,"Hi, good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about your responses on some of this trade policy uncertainty. I appreciated the transparency around building ahead with inventory. Will you continue to do that in this interim period until we get some clarity on Section 232 investigation? And could you talk a little bit about your philosophy on pricing, elevated costs to the extent that comes through, whether that be to resellers or end consumers and other efficiency efforts that you might be able to pursue? Thank you."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,24,Tim Cook,"Yes. Obviously, we're very engaged on the tariff discussions. We believe in engagement and we'll continue to engage. On the pricing piece, we have nothing to announce today. And I'll just say that the operational team has done an incredible job around optimizing the supply chain and the inventory. And we'll obviously continue to do those things to the degree that we can."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,25,Michael Ng,"Great. Thanks. And just as a quick follow-up for Kevan, on product gross margins, I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on some of the factors that may have impacted product gross margins in the quarter. Obviously, down sequentially on seasonal factors but there was a year-over-year decline as well. So any additional color would be helpful? Thank you."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,26,Kevan Parekh,"Yes, Michael, thanks. This is Kevan. So on the sequential, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we had a decrease in the product gross margin by 340 basis points sequentially. That was primarily driven by mix, seasonal loss of leverage, foreign exchange and that was partly offset by cost savings. And when we look at the year-on-year performance, we were down 70 basis points on a year-on- year basis. And that was driven by a different mix and foreign exchange."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,27,Michael Ng,Thank you.
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,28,Kevan Parekh,Thank you.
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,29,Suhasini Chandramouli,"Thank you, Mike. Operator, could we have the next question, please?"
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,30,Operator,Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,31,Amit Daryanani,"Thanks a lot. I guess I'll have to start with a tariff question as well. Tim, I think when you talked about the 900 million impact to your cost of goods sold, you sort of had a statement that there are certain unique factors that benefit you in the June quarter related to that number. Can you just talk about what are these unique factors that are benefiting you in the June quarter? And what would the impact be without those benefits essentially?"
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,32,Tim Cook,"I wouldn't want to go through all of them. But as an example, the build ahead that is -- I mentioned earlier that's in the manufacturing purchase obligations is -- were helpful."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,33,Amit Daryanani,"Got it. And then as I think about the June quarter guide of low to mid-single-digit revenue growth, I was wondering, do you folks expect services growth to remain in the double-digit range as you go into the back half of the year? I imagine FX is a bit of a benefit as you go to the back half. I would love to just understand, within that framework, how do you think services stacks up as you go through the June quarter?"
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,34,Kevan Parekh,"Yes, Amit. Hi, it's Kevan. So I think when we talk about the overall June quarter, we talk about the low to mid-single digits year- over-year. We do expect foreign exchange in the June quarter to improve sequentially. However, we are expecting it to be a slight headwind to revenue on a year-on-year basis. With respect to services, given the uncertainty we see from several factors, we aren't providing the category level of color today."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,35,Amit Daryanani,Got it. Thank you.
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,36,Kevan Parekh,Thank you.
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,37,Suhasini Chandramouli,"Thanks, Amit. Operator, could we have the next question, please?"
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,38,Operator,Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,39,Wamsi Mohan,"Yes. Thank you. Tim or Kevan, how should investors think about the gross margin trajectory as you source more from the U.S. in particular or other supply chain changes that you are making, including in India? How should those kind of play into the cost structure and how should we think about that gross margin trajectory and I will follow-up?"
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,40,Tim Cook,"We're excited about bringing more production to the U.S. As you know, we've been very key in the TSMC project in Arizona and are the largest and first customer getting product out of that. And that's the SoC that's coming out of there. We also have glass coming out of the U.S. and the Face ID module and loads of chips. In fact, there's 19 billion chips coming out across 12 states. This is down to the resistor and capacitor level, obviously. And so there's some that is already built into the margins that Kevan has quoted. And we don't really forecast beyond the current quarter as you know."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,41,Kevan Parekh,"Yes, maybe I'll add a couple of more points as we think about just the margin going forward. A couple of observations I'd mention is every product cycle is different and over the years we have managed gross margin well. We've made good decisions balancing units revenue margins. When we launch new products, they tend to have a higher cost structure than the products they replace as we introduce new features and technologies. We do have a good track record of reducing those costs and structures over the life of the product. And our products and services all have different levels of profitability and their relative success in the marketplace has an impact on the overall gross margin. So I hope that's helpful color and context for you."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,42,Wamsi Mohan,"No, that's super helpful. Thank you. I guess you just noted that you weren't going to give services maybe a growth forecast here in light of some of the uncertain news. But maybe, Tim, could you share any color around what you have seen in developer behavior in areas like Europe where there has now been emergence of alternate app stores for a little more time? What have you seen anecdotally or within your data in terms of maybe develop a behavior, whether it's large or small? Any color you can share on what has like actually happened?"
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,43,Tim Cook,"It's embedded in our results that Kevan talked about earlier and embedded in the overall company color that was provided. But as you know, the Digital Markets Act went into effect in, I believe it was March of last year. And so the Digital Markets Act has been enacted for a bit over a year and there's been alternate app stores for some period of time of that. And so it's -- at this point in Europe, there are some embedded in the actuals. There may be more to come and so forth. I don't want to predict beyond the current quarter."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,44,Wamsi Mohan,"Okay. Thank you, Tim."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,45,Suhasini Chandramouli,"Thank you, Wamsi. Operator, could we have the next question, please?"
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,46,Operator,Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,47,David Vogt,"Great. Thanks, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So I've got two as well, and Tim, this is more of a big picture supply chain philosophical question. So can you maybe update us on your thoughts on how you're thinking about your resiliency and redundancy, following the change that you guys talked about earlier on the call? I guess what I'm trying to understand is how do we think about where your supply chain is two to three years from now? And is there any risk, at least in the near term, of maybe some export control issues in your outlook for the balance of this year? And I'll give you my second one at the same time. You quantified a $900 million hit from tariffs. Or Kevan, is there any impact in how you're thinking about the demand backdrop in your outlook for the June quarter on the revenue line holistically? Thanks."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,48,Tim Cook,"In terms of the resiliency and risk, et cetera, there -- we have a complex supply chain. There's always risk in the supply chain. And so I wouldn't tell you anything different than that. What we learned some time ago was that having everything in one location had too much risk with it. And so we have, over time, with certain parts of the supply chain, not the whole thing, but certain parts of it opened up new sources of supply. And you could see that kind of thing continuing in the future. I'll let Kevan answer the other question."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,49,Kevan Parekh,"Hi, David. On the other question, I would say that our best thinking is captured in the outlook that we provided. However, I did want to reemphasize the point that the assumptions we made on the outlook do assume that the global tariff rates, the policies and application remain the same as they are today as of this call and that the global macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from today."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,50,David Vogt,"Okay. But no quantifiable impact on demand to date, at least from where we are over the last month? Is there a way to kind of think about that from early April to early May?"
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,51,Kevan Parekh,I would say our best thinking is reflected in the range that we provided.
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,52,David Vogt,"Okay. Thanks, Kevan. Thanks, guys."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,53,Kevan Parekh,Thank you.
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,54,Suhasini Chandramouli,"Thank you, David. Operator, could we have the next question, please?"
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,55,Operator,Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,56,Samik Chatterjee,"Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, Tim, you made a comment on the last earnings call about Apple Intelligence making a visible impact on iPhone sales in the countries where it was available. I'm just curious if you continue to see that play out similarly in the more broader number of countries you've rolled that out. Or the delays that you talked about related to Siri, personalized Siri features, has that had an impact in terms of consumer willingness to upgrade? And I have a follow-up. Thank you."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,57,Tim Cook,"Yes, thank you for the question. During the March quarter, we saw that in markets where we had rolled out Apple Intelligence, that the year-over-year performance on the iPhone 16 family was stronger than those where Apple Intelligence was not available. A lot of the languages that I think you're referring to rolled out in April and so they actually rolled out in Q3."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,58,Samik Chatterjee,"Okay, got it. Then maybe for my follow-up, I mean, you have a lot of insights now in terms of what consumers or how consumers are reacting to the overall macro. And I know you prefaced all your guidance with macro remaining consistent. But how -- what are you seeing in terms of the U.S. consumer? And what's the reaction there in terms of the tariff impact? We saw U.S. GDP also shrink here in 1Q. When you look at velocity at the stores or trade down within the iPhone portfolio mix, what are you seeing in terms of how the consumer is reacting to the macro at this point? Thank you."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,59,Tim Cook,"I'm not an economist and so I'd start by saying that. In terms of the -- as you can see from a total company point of view, our results accelerated sequentially to the 5% level. And the U.S. is obviously the vast majority of the Americas segment, and you can see how the Americas performed during the quarter. And so that's all I want to say about that. I don't want to try to predict what happens in the months from now. The past, I'm quite pleased with the results from Q2."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,60,Samik Chatterjee,Thank you. Thanks for taking the questions.
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,61,Tim Cook,Yes.
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,62,Suhasini Chandramouli,"Thank you, Samik. Operator, could we have the next question, please?"
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,63,Operator,Our next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,64,Krish Sankar,"Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them, too. Tim, thanks for that information on the $500 billion U.S. investment. I'm kind of curious how to think about the composition of that? How much is CapEx versus R&D? How much is going into like the Texas server? How much is going into maybe TSMC Arizona? Any kind of color you can give on that $500 billion investment would be helpful. And then I had a follow-up."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,65,Tim Cook,"Well, there's lots of all of it is what I would say. We're not giving out the exact split, but as we expand facilities in the different states from Michigan to Texas to California and Arizona and Nevada and Iowa and Oregon and North Carolina and Washington, there will be CapEx involved in that and OpEx involved in it. And standing up a server -- advanced server manufacturing in Texas, we did that through a partner. We do our manufacturing through a partner, but we'll be putting a fair amount in cost of goods sold to do that and some OpEx as well, and I'm sure some CapEx as well. And so it's a bit of all of it."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,66,Krish Sankar,"Got it, got it. And then kind of had like a long term, more like a philosophical question. When you look at -- in the past, you've spoken about AI on the Edge. Obviously, it's very topical to hear from both the iPhone angle and the Mac angle. But I'm just kind of curious, when you look at AI on Edge, are the current smartphone specs or improved hardware and silicon specs good enough to meet future Edge LLM for inference? Or do you think you need somewhat of a whole new different kind of device? Just kind of curious how to think about the evolution of the Edge devices from here."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,67,Tim Cook,"Yes. As you know, we're shipping an LLM on the iPhone 16 today. And there are -- some of the queries that are being used by our customers are on-device, and then others go to the private cloud where we've essentially mimicked the security and privacy of the device into the cloud. And then others, for world knowledge, are with the integration with ChatGPT. And so there's -- we continue to be very excited about the opportunities here. We are very excited about the road map, and we are pleased with the progress that we're making."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,68,Krish Sankar,"Thanks, sir."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,69,Suhasini Chandramouli,"Thank you, Krish. Operator, could we get the next question, please?"
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,70,Operator,Our next question is from Richard Kramer with Arete Research. Please go ahead.
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,71,Richard Kramer,"Thank you very much. Wanted to ask about tariffs. Tim, given your recognition that a new Siri system is taking longer than you thought to deliver, I'd like to go back to my question from the last call and ask about what some of the learnings you had from those delays and whether you attribute them to organizational factors, to your legacy software stack? Or is it a matter of R&D spending? And what are some of the key gating factors investors should look for either at WWDC or beyond to have a sense that Apple can deliver on some of the promises of the announcements of the prior WWDC? Thanks."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,72,Tim Cook,"Yes. If you sort of step back from what we said at WWDC, we talked about a number of different features that would launch with iOS 18. And we've released a slew of those from Writing Tools to seamlessly connecting to ChatGPT to Genmoji to Image Playground to Image Wand to Clean Up and Visual Intelligence, making movies or movies of your memories with a simple prompt, AI-powered photo search, smart replies, priority notifications, the list goes on. And so we've delivered a lot, and we've just recently, just a few weeks ago, expanded it into several different languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, simplified Chinese as well as localized English for both Singapore and India. So we've delivered a lot. However, with regard to the more personal Siri, as you mentioned, we just need more time to complete the work so they meet our high-quality bar. And there's not a lot of other reason for it. It's just taking a bit longer than we thought. But we are making progress, and we're extremely excited to get the more personal Siri features out there."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,73,Kevan Parekh,"And Richard, I'll just add that on your question about investment that we don't underestimate -- underinvest in our business. We make significant investments in R&D. That continues to grow. We're continuing to grow our R&D investment. And so we definitely are making all the investments we think we need to enable our road map."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,74,Richard Kramer,"Thanks. And Kevan, 1 for you. I mean, it's hard to ignore some of the ongoing very high-profile legal cases that touch on Apple, be it yesterday's Epic case injunction or the Google antitrust trial touching on default search. And investors are clearly concerned that these might have material impacts on your Services business. Do you feel now that you have ample ways in which you might be able to mitigate some of the potential negative impacts on Apple Services business that might come about from what's been proposed or might come about in legal rather than commercial pressures that the business faces?"
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,75,Tim Cook,"Let me make a couple of comments on that before Kevan. The case yesterday, we strongly disagree with. We've complied with the court's order and we're going to appeal. In the DOJ case that you referenced with Google, that case is ongoing and I don't really have anything to add beyond that. And so we're monitoring these closely. But there -- as you point out, there's risk associated with them and the outcome is unclear."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,76,Kevan Parekh,"Yes, I think Tim answered it really well. I don't have anything to add to that."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,77,Richard Kramer,Thank you.
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,78,Suhasini Chandramouli,"Thank you, Richard. Operator, we will take our last question, please."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,79,Operator,We'll go ahead and take our last question from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,80,Aaron Rakers,"Yes, thanks for taking the question. I want to go back to the AI strategy a little bit. I know, Tim, in your prepared comments, you had mentioned building some of your own foundational models. And I'm curious of how important you think it is for Apple to have their own foundational models. And kind of dovetailed with that is that, how do you think about your data center footprint when we look at Apple spending, call it, 3 billion a quarter relative to some of these other companies spending multiples of that. How does the strategy play out in your opinion?"
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,81,Tim Cook,"Well, we -- on the data center side, we have a hybrid strategy. And so we utilize third parties in addition to the data center investments that we're making. And as I've mentioned in the 500 billion, there's a number of states that we're expanding in. Some of those are data center investments. And so we do plan on making investments in that area and we're not gating it. We invest in the business first, as Kevan talked about, is our most important thing to do. In terms of the foundation models, we want to have certain models and we'll partner as well. And so I don't view it as a -- all of one or all of the other. We've been working on foundation models for quite some time and are shipping some today, obviously, with what's on-device and what's in the Private Cloud Compute."
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,82,Aaron Rakers,"Yes. And then as a follow-up, I'm curious with the iPhone 16e launching this quarter, internalizing your C1 modem, I'm curious of how you see kind of the modem strategy playing out or maybe just the continual deepening of that internal silicon opportunity for Apple?"
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,83,Tim Cook,We're super excited to ship the first 1 and get it out there and it's gone well. We love that we can produce better products from a point of view of really focusing on battery life and other things that customers want. And so we're -- we have started on a journey is the way I would put it.
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,84,Aaron Rakers,Thank you.
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,85,Tim Cook,Yes.
81201aa36c08e10ae102bdd7836ea217,86,Suhasini Chandramouli,"Thank you, Aaron.

8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,2,Timothy D. Cook,"Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, we are proud to report a June quarter revenue record of $94 billion, up 10% from a year ago, which was better than we expected. EPS set a June quarter record of $1.57, up 12% year-over-year. We saw an acceleration of growth around the world in the vast majority of markets we track, including Greater China and many emerging markets. And we had June quarter revenue records in more than two dozen countries and regions, including the U.S., Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, the Middle East, India and South Asia. These results were driven by double-digit growth across iPhone, Mac and Services. We set a June quarter record for iPhone, which grew a strong 13% year-over-year. We saw iPhone growth in every geographic segment and double-digit growth in emerging markets, including India, the Middle East, South Asia and Brazil. Mac continued to see excellent results with revenue up 15% year-over-year. And we set another all-time revenue record in Services, which grew 13% with double-digit growth in both developed and emerging markets. Last month, we hosted WWDC, an incredible event for our developer community with millions joining us online and more than 1,000 developers here in person at Apple Park. We shared some truly exciting updates, including a stunning new design crafted from a material we call Liquid Glass, it's both beautiful and expressive. And for the first time ever this design extends across all of our platforms. We can't wait for users everywhere to experience it this fall. And we were excited to share some updates across our AI work. We announced even more capabilities coming later this year, including live translation and Workout Buddy. In addition to those new features, we announced new support for a number of languages, and we opened up access to the on-device foundation models at the core of Apple Intelligence, enabling developers to build a whole new experience for our users. It's wonderful to see great momentum building for our platforms. iOS 26, macOS 26 and iPadOS 26 are by far the most popular developer betas we've had. Taking a step back, we see AI as one of the most profound technologies of our lifetime. We are embedding it across our devices and platforms and across the company. We are also significantly growing our investments. Apple has always been about taking the most advanced technologies and making them easy to use and accessible for everyone. And that's at the heart of our AI strategy. With Apple Intelligence, we're integrating AI features across our platforms in a way that is deeply personal, private and seamless, right where users need them. We've already released more than 20 Apple Intelligence features, including visual intelligence, cleanup and powerful writing tools. We're making good progress on a more personalized Siri, and as we've said before, we expect to release these features next year. Apple silicon is at the heart of all of these experiences, enabling powerful Apple Intelligence features to run directly on device. For more advanced tasks, our servers also powered by Apple silicon deliver even greater capabilities while preserving user privacy through our private cloud compute architecture. We believe our platforms offer the best way for users to experience the full potential of generative AI. Thanks to the exceptional performance of our systems, our users are able to run generative AI models right on their Mac, iPad and iPhone. We're excited about the work we're doing in this space, and it's incredibly rewarding to see the strong momentum building. Now let me turn to more details about our results for the quarter, starting with iPhone. iPhone revenue was $44.6 billion, up 13% from a year ago, and we set a June quarter record for upgraders. This strong broad-based performance was driven by the incredible popularity of the iPhone 16 family, which was up strong double digits year-over-year as compared to the 15 family. We also recently marked a significant milestone. We shipped the 3 billionth iPhone since its launch in 2007. From the Pro models with the powerhouse A18 Pro and innovative Pro camera features to the iPhone 16e with breakthrough battery life and a 2-in-1 camera system, users are finding so many reasons to love the best iPhone lineup we've ever created. And iOS 26 will take that experience even further. In addition to the beautiful new design and powerful Apple Intelligence features, it introduces a range of meaningful updates like real-time call screening and hold assist in the phone app, smarter messaging tools and new live translation features. It all adds up to a smarter, more personal iPhone experience that we can't wait for users everywhere to enjoy this fall. In Mac, we had another strong quarter with revenue of $8 billion, up 15% year-over-year, largely driven by the strength of the M4 MacBook Air. We set a June quarter record for upgraders on Mac, and we saw great performance in emerging markets with strong double-digit growth on revenue as well as strong double-digit growth on both upgraders and customers new to Mac. MacBook Air, the world's most popular laptop, unlocks a whole new level of performance with the power of M4. MacBook Pro customers meanwhile continue to be drawn to its incredible power and the longest battery life we've ever had on a Mac. Customers are also loving the newest Mac Studio, which is the most powerful Mac we've ever made with next-level capabilities to tackle even the most demanding AI workflows. At the same time, Mac mini continues to win over customers by packing so much performance into an ultracompact design. And with fantastic new updates in macOS Tahoe 26 6 from the phone app to live activities to our biggest ever update to Spotlight, Mac users across our entire lineup are going to find delightful new ways to stay connected and productive. For iPad, June quarter revenue was $6.6 billion. Our incredibly versatile iPad lineup brings together power and portability like never before. And users are already excited for our biggest iPad software update ever with the upcoming release of iPadOS 26. It starts with a new windowing system that's remarkably intuitive, giving users more control than ever of their iPad experience. An enhanced files app makes it easier than ever to stay organized. And that's all on top of a beautiful new software design that brings these updates to life. Turning to Wearables, Home and Accessories. Revenue was $7.4 billion, and we saw a June quarter record for upgraders to Apple Watch. During the quarter, we marked the 10-year anniversary of Apple Watch, celebrating a decade of helping users navigate their health and fitness journeys. And with watchOS 26 Apple Watch will be more intelligent than ever with smart updates to the workout app and Smart Stack, along with a fresh new design that feels both dynamic and personal. We're also thrilled about what's coming to Apple Vision Pro with visionOS 26 introducing spatial widgets that let users customize their digital space, more life-like personas and new enterprise APIs that empower companies to build their own spatial experiences. And this fall, new features for our latest AirPods lineup will unlock even more possibilities from studio quality audio recording to using AirPods as a camera remote, giving users powerful new ways to capture content and stay connected. As we're innovating across our lineup, we're especially proud of the work we're doing to help our users live healthier lives. Since we first launched our hearing health features for AirPods Pro 2, I've received notes from people who are delighted to be able to connect more deeply with loved ones. Whether it's with AirPods Pro 2 or Apple Watch or iPhone, it's amazing to see the power of our health and safety features from hearing tests to fall detection alerts to irregular rhythm notifications having such a profound impact. Turning to Services. Revenue for the June quarter was $27.4 billion, up 13% from a year ago and an all-time record. Apple TV+ scored 81 nominations, a record for the platform across nearly every eligible category for this year's Emmy Awards. Severance leads all Emmy nominees with 27 nominations and The Studio follows close behind with 23 nominations, more than any other freshman comedy series ever. It's amazing to see how these and other Apple TV shows have captured the popular imagination. To date, Apple TV+ has earned more than 2,700 award nominations and 585 wins on the strength of the highest-rated original content of any streaming network. And we continue to see very positive trends in the June quarter with TV+ viewership up strong double digits year-over-year. In June, we were also thrilled to release F1 in theaters around the world, one of the summer's most unforgettable blockbusters. During the quarter, we celebrated a big anniversary with 10 years of Apple Music. To mark the occasion, we launched an all-new studio space in Los Angeles for artists to create content and connect with fans. And later this year, we're bringing Apple Music users even more to love from an enhanced listening experience with AutoMix, which mixes songs like a DJ to lyrics translation and more. The App Store meanwhile continues to be the very best place to discover the latest apps from developers around the world in a safe and trusted way and App Store revenue grew double digits year-over-year, setting a June quarter record. In retail, we continue to find opportunities in emerging markets to connect with even more customers. We recently launched the Apple Store online in Saudi Arabia, and we couldn't be more excited to open new stores in the UAE and India later this year. We were also delighted to welcome customers in Japan to a new location in the heart of Osaka. Across everything we do at Apple, we show up by leading with our values. We feel strongly that the benefits of technology should be shared by everyone. That's why we make technology for everyone. In May, to mark Global Accessibility Awareness Day, we announced updates to help users learn, connect and interact with their worlds, including magnifier for Mac, a new braille experience and accessibility reader, a new system-wide reading mode to make it easier to understand content. And we're proud to introduce accessibility nutrition labels, giving users an understanding of accessibility features before they download an app while helping developers educate people on features their app support. This month, we also announced a $0.5 billion commitment with MP Materials to strengthen the supply of vital recycled rare earth materials in the U.S. and support American industry. And in August, we're opening our all-new Apple Manufacturing Academy in Detroit to train and support American manufacturers. These investments are part of Apple's largest ever spend commitment, which we announced earlier this year. Over the next 4 years, Apple is investing $500 billion in the U.S., driving innovation and creating jobs in cutting-edge fields like advanced manufacturing, silicon engineering and artificial intelligence. We're proud of this work and all that we're doing to tap into American innovation and bring the best technology experiences to users across the globe. And we continue to look for further opportunities to do even more. Finally, the situation around tariffs is evolving, so let me provide some color there. For the June quarter, we incurred approximately $800 million of tariff-related costs. For the September quarter, assuming the current global tariff rates, policies and applications do not change for the balance of the quarter and no new tariffs are added, we estimate the impact to add about $1.1 billion to our costs. This estimate should not be used to make projections for future quarters as there are many factors that could change, including tariff rates. We're really proud of our results for the June quarter, and I want to thank our teams and our customers. In everything we do, we're driven by transformative innovation, delivering the most exceptional products and services we've ever created, and we're especially excited about what's ahead. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevan."
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,3,Kevan Parekh,"Thanks, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Our revenue of $94 billion was up 10% year-over-year and is a new June quarter record. We grew in every geographic segment and in the vast majority of the markets we track. Products revenue was $66.6 billion, up 8% year-over-year, driven by growth across iPhone and Mac. And thanks to our high levels of customer satisfaction and strong loyalty, our installed base of active devices reached another all-time high across all product categories and geographic segments. Services revenue was $27.4 billion, up 13% year-over-year and an all-time record. We saw strength across the world with double-digit growth in the majority of our markets. Company gross margin was 46.5% at the high end of our guidance range and down 60 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by approximately $800 million in tariff-related costs Tim mentioned earlier. Products gross margin was 34.5%, down 140 basis points sequentially, driven by mix and tariff-related costs, partly offset by cost savings. Services gross margin was 75.6%, down 10 basis points sequentially. Operating expenses landed at $15.5 billion, up 8% year- over-year. This strong business performance led to June quarter records for both net income at $23.4 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.57, which was up 12% year-over-year. Operating cash flow was also strong at $27.9 billion. Now I'm going to provide some more details for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $44.6 billion, up 13% year-over- year, driven by the iPhone 16 family. As Tim noted, we saw iPhone growth in every geographic segment and double-digit growth in many emerging markets. The iPhone active installed base grew to an all-time high in total and in every geographic segment, and we reached a June quarter record for upgraders. According to a recent survey from Worldpanel, formerly of Kantar, iPhone was a top-selling model in the U.S., Urban China, the U.K., Australia and Japan during the June quarter. And we continue to see very high levels of customer satisfaction in the U.S. at 98% as measured by 451 Research. Mac revenue was $8 billion, up 15% year-over-year, driven by continued strength across the portfolio, including MacBook Air, Mac mini and MacBook Pro. We grew in every geographic segment and saw double-digit growth in Europe, Greater China and the rest of Asia Pacific. The Mac installed base reached an all-time high, and we hit a June quarter record for upgraders. In the U.S., customer satisfaction was recently measured at 97%. iPad revenue was $6.6 billion, down 8% year-over-year, which was expected given the difficult compare against the launch of the iPad Air and iPad Pro in the year ago quarter. At the same time, the iPad installed base reached another all-time high and over half of the customers who purchased an iPad during the quarter were new to the product. And based on the latest reports from 451 Research, customer satisfaction was 98% in the U.S. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $7.4 billion, down 9% year-over-year. This was driven by a difficult compare on accessories due to the prior year's iPad launches that I just referred to. The Apple Watch installed base reached a new all-time high with over half of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. We also set a quarterly record for upgraders on Apple Watch and the latest customer satisfaction for Watch in the U.S. was reported at 97%. Our Services revenue reached an all-time high of $27.4 billion, up 13% year-over-year. The performance in the June quarter was broad-based. We saw a sequential acceleration across the majority of the categories, including cloud services, where we reached an all-time revenue record, driven by the year-over-year growth of iCloud paying accounts. We saw strong momentum during the June quarter and the growth of our installed base of active devices gives us great opportunities for the future. Customer engagement across our Services offerings also continued to grow. Both transacting and paid accounts reached new all- time highs with paid accounts growing double digits year-over-year. Paid subscriptions also grew double digits. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the Services on our platform. We continue to improve the quality and breadth of our Service offerings from the new Apple Games app to a continued expansion of Tap to Pay and Wallet. Turning to enterprise. Organizations are continuing to invest in Apple products to drive employee innovation and productivity. With companies like PayPal and Roche deploying more Macs for their workforce, we had the best June quarter ever for Mac in enterprise. In Thailand, Siam Commercial Bank, one of the largest Thai banks, has deployed thousands of iPads across their branches to enhance the quality and efficiency of their banking operations from loan services to wealth management. CAE, a leader in pilot training and simulation technology is using Apple Vision Pro to enable pilots to become more familiar with aircraft procedures, leading to more productive in-person flight simulator training outcomes. Let's turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $133 billion in cash and marketable securities. We had $5.7 billion of debt maturities, issued $4.5 billion of new debt and increased commercial paper by $4 billion, resulting in $102 billion in total debt. Therefore, at the end of the quarter, net cash was $31 billion. During the quarter, we returned over $27 billion to shareholders. This included $3.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and $21 billion through open market repurchases of 104 million Apple shares. As we move into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to. Importantly, the color we're providing assumes that the global tariff rates, policies and application remain in effect as of this call, the global macroeconomic outlook does not worsen from today and the current revenue share agreement with Google continues. We expect our September quarter total company revenue to grow mid- to high single digits year-over-year. We expect Services revenue to grow at a year-over-year rate similar to what we reported in the June quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 46% and 47%, which includes the estimated impact of the $1.1 billion tariff-related costs that Tim referred to earlier. We expect operating expenses to be between $15.6 billion and $15.8 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $25 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 17%. Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.26 per share of common stock payable on August 14, 2025, to shareholders of record as of August 11, 2025. With that let's open the call to questions."
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,4,Suhasini Chandramouli,"Thank you, Kevan. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, may we have the first question, please?"
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,5,Operator,"Certainly, we'll go ahead and take our first question from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs."
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,6,Michael Ng,"I just have one on upgrade rates and one on CapEx. First, on the upgrade rates, it's encouraging to see the records on iPhone, Mac and Watch. I was wondering if you're seeing strength in the upgrade rates? Or is the records more a function of the growing installed base? What is your research showing that made upgrades particularly compelling this year? For example, is it product features, tariff pull forward, perhaps Apple Intelligence? And then I'll give my follow-up on CapEx."
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,7,Timothy D. Cook,You'll do CapEx first.
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,8,Kevan Parekh,"Yes, I'll do CapEx first."
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,9,Michael Ng,"Just on the CapEx, it's up notably year-to-date. Could you just comment on your capital spending plan this year and next and provide some qualitative color in terms of what's driving that growth? Is it AI-related or supply chain diversification, for instance?"
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,10,Kevan Parekh,"Yes, Mike, it's a combination of factors. I would say, a pretty significant driver as Tim talked about, is the fact we are increasing our investment significantly in AI. So that is certainly a component of it. As you know, we've been investing in private cloud compute, which is also in our first-party data centers. The other piece, as you know, is we do have a hybrid strategy where in cases we do use third parties to make capital investments, and we also invest in our own. So you are going to see an increase in CapEx. We also, from time to time, have other investments in facilities, in toolings, but I would say a significant portion of the driver of growth that you're seeing now is really driven by some of our AI-related investments."
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,11,Timothy D. Cook,"On the upgrades, Michael, if you look at iPhone, the 16 family grew double digit as opposed to the 15 family from the year ago quarter. And so we did set an upgrade record. I think it directly is because of the strength of the product. Mac also set records on upgrade, and I think we continue to see a move to Apple silicon and the performance of Apple silicon is playing a very key role. And so it was an incredible quarter. In terms of -- if you're wondering about pull forward, we would estimate the pull forward of demand into April, specifically to be about 1 point of the 10 points in terms of people buying because of discussions about tariffs."
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,12,Operator,Our next question is from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley.
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,13,Erik William Richard Woodring,"I have two as well. Tim maybe starting with you, shortly after March quarter earnings, there were some reports about searches on Safari declining in April for the first time, I think, in over 2 decades. Judging by your 13% Services growth this quarter, it doesn't seem to indicate that April trends necessarily played out through the remainder of the June quarter. And so I'm really just looking for a little bit more color on really how the rest of the quarter played out. And if you believe Apple products as kind of search access points are losing their strategic value as AI platforms become more valuable, popular or increasing in strategic value. And then I have a follow-up."
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,14,Timothy D. Cook,"I think they continue to be very valuable. I think that consumers' behaviors are evolving, and we're monitoring it very closely."
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,15,Erik William Richard Woodring,"Okay. I appreciate that color. And then maybe second to that, I'd love if you could maybe elaborate a bit on what you're seeing in China. I think in an interview earlier this afternoon, you alluded to some of the promotions being tailwinds. But just bigger picture, if we take a step back in China, how would you characterize demand interest in the iPhone 16 and some of your other products? Is that shifting or maybe were some of the trends in the June quarter maybe a bit more onetime and unique in nature?"
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,16,Timothy D. Cook,"Yes. We did grow in Greater China by 4% during the quarter versus the previous quarter, it was driven by an acceleration by iPhone, although we also had substantial growth on the Mac year-over-year. From a -- as you know, the government has placed certain subsidies that affects some of our products, not all of them, but there are some of them. And I think that had some effect. It was the first full quarter of the subsidy playing out, that cut in during a portion of the previous quarter. The other things I would say are that the installed base hit a record high in Greater China, and we set an all-time record for the iPhone installed base. The iPhone upgraders in Mainland China set a record for the June quarter. And according to Worldpanel, which was formerly known as Kantar, iPhone had the top 3 models in Urban China, which is extraordinary. Also, if you look at the other products, Mac, iPad and Watch, the majority of customers that are buying in China Mainland were new to the product. So lots of good things there. And the other thing I would point out, which is an interesting point, The MacBook Air was the top-selling laptop model in all of China, and the Mac mini was the top-selling desktop model in all of China. So overall, a positive -- very positive quarter."
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,17,Operator,Our next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research.
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,18,Benjamin Alexander Reitzes,"I really appreciate it. I wanted to ask about Siri, Tim, and just overall AI investment. There's a perception that Siri is going to help drive other new products potentially that maybe where voice is quite needed. And just wondering how's your confidence towards launching that next year? Is there anything that's been done internally to increase that confidence? Is it tied to the investment? I just think folks would love to know a little bit more about your confidence in how that's going? And then I have a follow-up."
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,19,Timothy D. Cook,"Yes. Thanks for the question. We're making good progress on a more personalized Siri, and we do expect to release the features next year, as we had said earlier, our focus from an AI point of view is on putting AI features across the platform that are deeply personal, private and seamlessly integrated. And of course, we've done that with more than 20 Apple Intelligence features so far from visual intelligence to cleanup to writing tools and all the rest. We are significantly growing our investment, we did during the June quarter, we will again in the September quarter. I'm not putting specific numbers behind that at this point, but you can probably tell from the guidance that things are moving up. We are also reallocating a fair number of people to focus on AI features within the company. That are -- we have a great team, and we're putting all of our energy behind it. In terms of other products, I don't want to really comment on specific other products. But we have an exciting road map ahead and I could not be more excited about it."
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,20,Benjamin Alexander Reitzes,"That's great, Tim. Just with regard to my second question, it's about the overall revenue guide. And I appreciate that you guide the best you can see it. But I just wanted to challenge it from a different way is, why would it decelerate if Services is staying the same at 13%. What -- is there a conservatism there? I would think even currency is just as favorable, if not more favorable. So why would it decelerate to the higher single digits from where you were in the quarter? Or is it just being conservative? And if there's something decelerating or comp, do you mind just pointing that out?"
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,21,Kevan Parekh,"Yes, Ben, this is Kevan. Thanks for the question. I think when you look at the growth from Q3, we just reported to the mid- to high single-digit guide. I think you have to kind of keep in mind two components. The first is the effect of the tariff-related pull-ahead in demand that Tim referenced earlier, which we estimated to be about 1 point of the 10 points that we ended up doing in Q3. And then the other factor that I think you have to take into consideration is the fact that in September quarter a year ago, we had the full quarter impact of the iPad launches, which also leads to a difficult compare this year. So those two components are things you have to take into consideration as you think about the move from Q3 to Q4. I would say foreign exchange is a very minor tailwind going from Q3 to Q4, so not really a major factor."
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,22,Operator,Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. .
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,23,Wamsi Mohan,"Tim, I know you said similar growth in Services, and that's predicated with Google payments continuing. Is there any way for us to dimensionalize sort of -- or maybe just conceptually talk about maybe options if, if the counter were to happen, if the payments were not allowed in some way, what are some of the things that Apple could do given that it is a significant chunk of profitability? And I have a follow-up."
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,24,Timothy D. Cook,"Yes, Wamsi, I don't really want to speculate on the court ruling and how they would rule and what we would do as a consequence of it."
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,25,Wamsi Mohan,"Okay. Okay. I guess we'll wait for that ruling to come out. I guess, separately, Tim, at a high level, when you look at some of what is perceived fears of new form factors and ways to interact with devices. There was some worry that given some of the developments in AI that there could be a world where dependence on screen-based devices significantly diminishes. And I'm kind of curious to get your thoughts on if do you think that would happen and rate and pace in which? And how do you think Apple is preparing in that case?"
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,26,Timothy D. Cook,"When you think about all the things an iPhone can do from connecting people to bringing app and game experiences to life to taking photos and videos to helping users explore the world and conduct their financial lives and pay for things and so much more. It's difficult to see a world where iPhone is not living in it. And that doesn't mean that we are not thinking about other things as well. But I think that, that the devices are likely to be complementary devices, not substitution."
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,27,Operator,Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,28,Amit Jawaharlaz Daryanani,"I guess just to start with -- Tim, the tariff assumption of $1.1 billion in the September quarter, I kind of -- I understand the uptick you folks are talking about. But can you just talk about assuming tariffs remain at these levels or even they evolve under Section 232, how do you eventually think about offsetting this headwind to your P&L? And when do you decide to execute on the levers to offset this headwind versus just flowing into your bottom line?"
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,29,Timothy D. Cook,"Right now, we're just estimating the cost of it, and it's up quarter-over-quarter, because our volume is up quarter-over-quarter. And there was some build ahead in the previous quarter. And so that's the primary reason that it's up. In terms of what we do to mitigate, we obviously try to optimize our supply chain and ultimately, we're -- we will do more in the United States. We've committed $500 billion investment in the U.S. over the next 4 years. And we're already building chips in Arizona. And in fact, we're building semiconductors across 12 states in 24 factories, and have a lot of other things in the work. You probably saw the investment in MP Materials last week. And so we continue to explore these things and look for more that we can do, which I think ultimately is the objective."
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,30,Amit Jawaharlaz Daryanani,"Got it. Super helpful. And then your Services growth, I think, was extremely impressive at 13%, especially given all the fears folks had. Can you just touch on, did you see any impact that was notable from the Epic case and the steering dynamics that came after that? And maybe just touch on what does that appeal process looks like for you as you go forward? ."
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,31,Kevan Parekh,"Yes, this is Kevan. Let me take that one. In general, I think just reminding, I think you just said, we had a very strong Services quarter, we had an all-time record at the $27.4 billion, up 13%. The one thing I would also say is our services performance was broad- based. So we also saw strength in developed and emerging markets, both parts of the world had double-digit growth. We also saw a sequential acceleration across the majority of our categories, including cloud services, where I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we had an all-time revenue record. As it relates to the EPIC decision, we -- keep in mind, we only just introduced the change required by the court in the June quarter. And as you know, we don't provide the level of detail. But in general, I would say it was a very, very -- in the U.S., we had a double- digit growth for the U.S. App Store, and we set an all-time record. And so we'll continue to monitor the effects on our business, but we'll continue to innovate and ensure that the App Store delivers the best experience for users and remains a great business opportunity for developers."
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,32,Operator,Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS.
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,33,David Vogt,"And I have two questions as well. Maybe Tim, just on the supply chain strategy. I know last quarter, you talked about focusing production or assembly to India. And I just want to get an update on how you're thinking about the strategy holistically, given sort of the tariff rates, I think, in India potentially are higher than I think anyone had expected. So I know you mentioned some U.S. investments, would love to kind of get your thoughts on how you're thinking about China versus the rest of Southeast Asia and India going forward? And then I'll give you my second question also. So Kevan, I'm just trying to understand a little bit more about the demand drivers of iPhone in the quarter because obviously, the 16 has been in the market for some time. I know there was some promotional activity. But seasonally, you generally don't see this kind of strength in the June quarter. Maybe you can help us understand outside of maybe the promotional activity, what else were some of the drivers that led to what was -- looks like a pretty significant above seasonal strength in the June quarter stats?"
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,34,Timothy D. Cook,"Yes. In terms of the tariff situation and country of origin and so forth. One thing I would say, just to remind everyone is keep in mind that the vast majority of our products are covered under the Section 232 investigation. And so the -- today or I should say, last quarter, the bulk of the tariffs that we paid were the IEEPA tariffs that hit early in the year related to China. And so that's just a reminder of where things are and what we assumed as we calculated the projection of $1.1 billion that's in our outlook color. In terms of the country of origin, it's the same as I referenced last quarter. There hasn't been a change to that, which is the vast majority of the iPhone sold in the U.S. or the majority, I should say, have a country of origin of India and the vast majority of the products, other products, the Mac and the iPad and the Watch have a country of origin of Vietnam that are sold in the United States. Still, the products for other international countries, the vast majority of them are coming from China. And so that hopefully gives you a flavor of the of where things are. But I would stress again that we do a lot in this country in the United States. And we've committed $500 billion, and we're always looking to do more. And you could kind of see that in the most recent announcements, whether it's MP Materials or our manufacturing academy that we're standing up in Detroit in a couple of weeks or so. And so we're going to be doing -- we're doing more in this country, and that's on top of having roughly 19 billion chips coming out of the U.S. now, and we will do more, and of course, glass from iPhone and the Face ID module. And so there's loads of different things that are done in the United States."
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,35,Kevan Parekh,"And then, David, as..."
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,36,David Vogt,And then on the iPhone activity?
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,37,Kevan Parekh,"Yes. So I was going to mention the iPhone activity. You asked if there's any kind of unique characteristics this quarter? I would just say, as Tim outlined, we really believe that the strong upgrade performance, which was a June quarter record was really driven by the strength of the product lineup. The iPhone 16 family has done incredibly well compared to the iPhone 15 family. And we also, as you recall, recently introduced the 16e as well, which also continued to impact the success of the overall iPhone 16 lineup."
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,38,Operator,Our next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen.
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,39,Krish Sankar,"I have two of them. The first one is for Kevan, this was a previous question, do you think there was any pull-in of iPhones in the June quarter that led to some of the upside? And how to think about channel inventory in June quarter? And how it looks in September relative to seasonal trends? And then I had a longer-term follow-up for Tim."
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,40,Timothy D. Cook,"Let me see if I can answer the channel inventory question or what I think is the channel inventory question. If you look at iPhone channel inventory from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter, we reduced it, and it ended toward the low end of our targeted range. And so that's the answer on the inventory piece of it."
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,41,Kevan Parekh,"And then I think you also asked about the pull-ahead impact. I think we referenced that earlier. Just to be clear on what we believe we saw in the June quarter, we did see some obvious signs of pull-ahead really in the April time frame around the tariff-related discussions that were out in the marketplace. And so we felt that, that was from what we saw about a 1 point impact of the 10 points at a total company level of growth. And so that was the limited impact that we believe we saw for the quarter."
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,42,Krish Sankar,"Got it. Very helpful. And then I just have like a long-term follow-up for Tim. Tim, I'm kind of curious about your thoughts on AI for edge devices. There's like some people who think that LLM could be a commodity in the future. Do you think -- do you see a scenario where the LLMs become a core part of your iOS or is the SLM the way to go and how to think about evolution of edge devices in a futuristic AI world and if smartphone going to be the choice of device. Just curious your thoughts on it, broadly speaking."
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,43,Timothy D. Cook,"The way that we look at AI is that it's one of the most profound technologies of our lifetime. And I think it will affect all devices in a significant way. What pieces of the chain are commoditized and not commoditized, I wouldn't want to really talk about today because that gives away some things on our strategy. But I think it's a good question."
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,44,Operator,Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,45,Samik Chatterjee,"Tim, maybe if I can start with your remarks about the pull-ahead being about a 1 percentage point benefit here. Anything to share in terms of how -- what's underlying that estimate in terms of what you're seeing for -- is it a pull-ahead largely on iPhones? Or is it across the board? And is it primarily in the U.S. or again, sort of across multiple regions? Any color there would be helpful in terms of how you're sort of getting to that assumption there. And I have a follow-up."
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,46,Timothy D. Cook,It was principally on iPhone and Mac. And it was pretty -- it was obvious evidence of it. It was an unusual buying pattern there and that largely occurred in April towards the beginning of the quarter. And it was really -- we believe it was largely the United States.
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,47,Samik Chatterjee,"Okay. Okay. Got it. And maybe on the tariff front, when you gave the estimate of $900 million last quarter, which came in at $800 million, you did highlight it was -- there were some unique factors in the quarter. When I take the $1.1 billion that you're now sort of expecting for the September quarter and as we start to think about December, would -- is there anything unique in the December quarter in terms of sourcing from regions, et cetera, that would uniquely impact December, just given sort of that you had highlighted that quarter-to-quarter, so there would be unique things. Just curious if December looks very different from September because of any unique factors."
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,48,Timothy D. Cook,"I would be careful about projecting based on the numbers from Q2 and Q3 because, one, we're uncertain of what the rates will be. And so the rates may change. Two, in -- particularly in last quarter, we had some build ahead inventory that we were -- that we had within the company and within our supplier -- within our supply chain. And so those two are a little unique. Also, as you know, from following us for so long, Q1 is generally a higher volume quarter. And the tariffs are currently are pretty linear with volume."
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,49,Operator,Our next question is from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo.
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,50,Aaron Christopher Rakers,"I've got two as well, and I'll just ask them together. I guess the first one is just more housekeeping. Kevan, when we think about currency impact, how much of a benefit was currency this quarter, and I guess across the business and in particular, maybe on the Services segment, and on a year-on-year basis, how much currency benefit should we be thinking about embedded in the guidance into the September quarter? And then the second quick question is CapEx is clearly moving higher. I know you guys don't guide specifically to that number. But just kind of qualitatively, should we -- as you lean in more on AI, should we really start to see that CapEx, which is running close to about $4 billion annualized today, really start to move appreciably higher? Any color on that would be helpful."
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,51,Kevan Parekh,"Great, Aaron. Thanks for the questions. Let me answer the first one, first around foreign exchange. For Q3, we really had no impact from a foreign exchange standpoint on the year-on-year results. And so -- when we look at both the revenue growth as well as the gross margin, there was virtually no impact from foreign exchange. As we look at going from Q3 to June quarter to the September quarter, again, very, very, as I mentioned earlier, a very small tailwind going from Q3 to Q4 from a foreign exchange standpoint on both revenue as well as gross margin. And then on the second question, sure, on the CapEx side, I think we talked about the fact that we are, and Tim mentioned the fact that we are increasing our investment significantly in AI. You are going to continue to see our CapEx grow. It's not going to be exponential growth, but it is going to grow substantially. And a lot of that's a function of the investments we're making in AI. As we mentioned, we also have other items that fall under that category, facilities and some of our retail store investments. But I would say a lot of the growth is really being driven by AI. I would remind you that we do have a hybrid model though, where we also leverage third-party infrastructure in addition to investing in our own first-party infrastructure."
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,52,Operator,Our next question is from Atif Malik with Citi.
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,53,Atif Malik,"Tim, at the WWDC earlier in the quarter, you showed impressive updates on Vision Pro with the use of widget, spatial scenes, persona and new ways to create content. Appears like Meta and Xiaomi are seeing strong momentum on their AI glasses. So is the focus still around enterprises on Vision Pro? Or are you thinking of broadening the use cases and maybe tying it to more of your devices? Any thoughts on Vision Pro as they did not get enough airtime in the prepared remarks."
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,54,Timothy D. Cook,"Yes. Thanks for bringing it up. I was thrilled with the release from the team on visionOS 26. It includes many things in it like spatial widgets to enable users to customize their digital space. The personas took a huge increase. They're much more lifelike. And of course, there's new enterprise APIs for companies as well. And we're seeing, as Kevan talked about in his opening remarks, we're seeing those things resonate out with CAE and other customers. And so we continue to be very focused on it. And I don't want to get into the road map on it, but this is an area that we really believe in."
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,55,Atif Malik,"Great. And Kevan, historically, you guys have not done much big M&A. Do you feel like you need to accelerate your AI road map or just keep the organic focus?"
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,56,Timothy D. Cook,"Let me take that one as well. We've acquired around seven companies this year. And that's companies from all walks of life, not all AI oriented. And so we're doing one, think of it as one every several weeks. We're very open to M&A that accelerates our road map. We are not stuck on a certain size company, although the ones that we have acquired thus far this year are small in nature. But we basically ask ourselves whether a company can help us accelerate a road map. If they do, then we're interested, but we don't have anything to share specifically today."
8c6850f0f619e76b2f1b87fe135e3b68,57,Suhasini Chandramouli,"All right. Thank you, Atif.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks."
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,2,Timothy Cook,"Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is proud to report $102.5 billion in revenue, up 8% from a year ago and a September quarter record. Services achieved an all-time revenue record of $28.8 billion, growing 15% from a year ago. EPS came in at $1.85 setting a September quarter record. We grew in the vast majority of markets we track and had September quarter revenue records in dozens of markets, including the U.S., Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, the Middle East, Japan, Korea and South Asia. We also set a September quarter revenue record in emerging markets and an all-time revenue record in India. These results come at the close of an extraordinary year for Apple in which we achieved an all-time revenue record of $416 billion for the fiscal year. We set all-time revenue records in emerging and developed markets. We set an all-time revenue record for iPhone. And in Services, we achieved all-time records across every geographic segment. These results reflect the tremendous customer enthusiasm for Apple products and services as well as our deep commitment to innovation. We are incredibly excited about the strength we're seeing across our products and services and we expect the December quarter's revenue to be the best ever for the company and the best ever for iPhone. We are heading into the holiday season with a truly remarkable lineup. That includes the biggest leap ever for iPhone, which has had a tremendous response from our users around the world. Our Apple Watch lineup is more capable than ever to giving users ways to take charge of their health like never before, through new features like hypertension notifications and sleep score. And the next level sound quality and active noise cancellation of AirPods Pro 3 are hitting all the right notes for our users. In October, we also broke new ground and power-efficient performance with the uncomparably fast M5 chip, packed with neural accelerators in each GPU core to supercharge AI workflows. iPad Pro combines game-changing features in iPad OS 26 with the power of M5 to create our most capable iPad ever. At the same time, the M5 MacBook Pro raises the bar for what users can do with a laptop while the new M5 powered Apple Vision Pro opens up amazing possibilities on its infinite canvas. We also launched a beautiful new software design that creates a unified experience across all of our platforms for the very first time. The design is crafted with a new material called liquid glass that brings fluidity, vitality and flexibility to our products. Along with the new design, we delivered powerful new features to enable users to do even more with their devices. That includes updates to the phone and messages apps in iOS 26 to help users stay connected, continuity enhancements in MAC to deliver an even more seamless experience across devices and a powerful new windowing system that fundamentally transforms the user experience in iPad OS 26. As we continue to expand our investment in AI, we're bringing intelligence to more of what people already love about our products and services, making every experience even more personal, capable and effortless. At the heart of it all is Apple Silicon, and we were thrilled to launch new products powered by the A19 Pro chip and M5. These incredibly advanced chips make Apple products the very best place to experience the power of AI. With Apple Intelligence, we've introduced dozens of new features that are powerful, intuitive, private and deeply integrated into the things people do every day. Features like live translation, which help users communicate across languages in real time and visual intelligence, which opens new ways to learn about and explore the world. We also introduced Workout Buddy, a new experience that uses AI to provide personalized motivational insights based on a user's workout data and fitness history. And these joined so many others from cleanup and photos and new image creation tools to powerful writing tools, we're also seeing developers take advantage of our own device foundation models to create entirely new experiences for users around the world. We're also excited for our more personalized Siri. We're making good progress on it. And as we've shared, we expect to release it next year. Now let's take a closer look at the September quarter results across our lineup, starting with iPhone. iPhone set a revenue record for the September quarter at $49 billion, up 6% from a year ago, with growth in the vast majority of markets we track despite supply constraints we faced on several iPhone 16 and iPhone 17 models given strong demand. Redesigned from the inside out and powered by the outstanding A19 pro chip, the iPhone 17 Pro is by far the most powerful iPhone we've ever made, setting a whole new standard for the smartphone industry. The iPhone 17 Pro also offers our best camera system ever with an all-new ADEX telephoto camera and look stunning with bold new finishes like COSMIC Orange. The iPhone Air introduces an incredibly breakthrough design and with a bigger and brighter display with promotion, the iPhone 17 is a fantastic upgrade packed with features users will love. In MAC, we had a strong September quarter with revenue of $8.7 billion, up 13% year-over-year driven by the strength of the MacBook Air. The MacBook Air enables users to get things done easily on the world's most popular laptop. Mac mini users are loving how much performance is packed into our smallest Mac ever made while Mac Studio customers are pushing the envelope of what's possible with our most powerful Mac ever, and the latest 14-inch MacBook Pro unlocks incredible speed and next level performance with the all-new M5 chip, which delivers 3.5x faster AI performance than M4. Turning to iPad. Revenue was $7 billion for the September quarter. Last month, we released 1 of the most attention grabbing software updates we've had in years with iPad OS 26 and we recently gave iPad users even more to love with the launch of the incredible M5 iPad Pro, which offers an incredible boost in AI performance. With an unmatched combination of power and versatility, the new iPad Pro makes every interaction delightful with its thin, light and portable design. In Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $9 billion. As I mentioned earlier, we were excited to unlock new possibilities for users with the launch of our newest Apple Watch lineup, making the world's most popular watch even better. That includes Apple Watch Ultra 3 with the largest display ever in an Apple watch, improved battery life and emergency SOS via satellite. Apple Watch Series 11 brings our users the most comprehensive set of health features yet. And Apple Watch SC3 delivers advanced capabilities at an incredible value. AI and advanced machine learning are at the core of powerful health features like heart rate monitoring, fall detection, crash detection and more. With our latest Apple Watch lineup, we were proud to introduce hypertension notifications, developed using large-scale machine learning models. Hypertension is one of the leading risk factors for heart attack and stroke affecting more than 1 billion adults worldwide, and we expect to notify more than 1 million users of this life-threatening condition. We're also excited about sleep score, a simple, intuitive way to help users better understand their sleep quality and discover ways to improve it. That's something I'm sure we can all benefit from. Meanwhile, AirPods Pro 3 have been a huge hit. You have to hear them to really understand just how remarkable they are. users and reviewers alike are praising their incredible sound quality and improved fit. They feature the world's best in-ear active noise cancellation, removing up to 2x as much noise as the previous generation. And with live translation powered by Apple Intelligence, AirPods deliver an incredibly new and exciting experience for users around the world. Turning to Services. As I mentioned earlier, revenue was $28.8 billion for the September quarter, 15% higher year-over-year and an all-time record. We saw double-digit growth in both developed and emerging markets and set new all-time records across advertising, App Store, cloud services, Music, payment services and video. Apple TV celebrated a big night at this year's Emmy Awards with 22 wins. The studio led the night with 13 wins the most of any comedy series in Emmy's history. Severance topped all dramas with 8 wins, adding to the accolades for this landmark series. To date, Apple TV productions have now earned over 600 wins and 2,800 nominations in total, driven by powerful original storytelling. And we're excited for audiences to discover new productions like Pluribus and to catch returning favorites like slow horses and the morning show. And soon, Apple TV will be the destination for F1 fans across the U.S. on track Day, thanks to a new partnership with Formula One. F1 is one of the most exciting and fastest-growing sports in the world. And starting next year, Apple TV will be the place for subscribers to follow every twist and turn of the new season. And in addition, F1, the movie, one of the year's biggest blockbusters will be coming to Apple TV on December 12. During the September quarter, we also marked the 10-year anniversary of Apple News. Apple News provides access to front page news from all around the world, putting hundreds of publications right at users' fingertips. Turning to retail. We're heading into our busiest time of year with our best ever lineup. In the last few months, we've opened new stores in emerging markets like India and the UAE and new locations in the U.S. and China. I was also in Tokyo last month for the opening of the redesigned and reimagined Apple Ginza store and the energy among the crowd was truly remarkable. When it originally opened, it was our first store outside the United States, and so it was especially meaningful to come back to welcome customers to the beautiful new space. Everywhere we operate, and in everything we do, we strive to give the best to our users while living by our values, whether that's building new accessibility features into our most recent software releases or advancing our environmental work by using even more recycled materials in our latest lineup or providing free educational programming to train and support American businesses with our new Apple Manufacturing Academy in Detroit. And we're continuing to invest in innovation and user experiences that will transform our future. A great example is the work we're doing in the U.S. where we're committed to invest $600 billion over the next 4 years with a focus on innovation in strategic areas like advanced manufacturing, silicon engineering and artificial intelligence. These commitments build on our long-standing investments in America, while supporting more than 450,000 jobs with thousands of suppliers across all 50 states. We built a new factory in Houston for advanced AI service, for example, which just started shipping its first products off the line, and we're leading the creation of end-to-end silicon supply chain across the country. In recent months, I've connected with developers, innovators, artists, entrepreneurs and so many others around the world, people passionate about innovation and all the things they can do with Apple products. Each one is another reminder of why we do what we do. We're driven to empower people to do more of the things that matter most to them and enrich their lives along the way. As we head into the holiday season with our most powerful lineup ever, I couldn't be more excited for what's to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevan."
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,3,Kevan Parekh,"Thanks, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Our revenue of $102.5 billion was up 8% year-over-year and is a new September quarter record. We set some temporal quarter records in the Americas, Europe, Japan and the rest of Asia Pacific and grew in the vast majority of markets we track. Products revenue was $73.7 billion, up 5% year-over-year, driven by growth across iPhone and MAC and reached a September quarter record. Thanks to our exceptional customer satisfaction and strong levels of loyalty, our installed base of active devices has reached another all-time high across all product categories and geographic segments. Services revenue was $28.8 billion, up 15% year-over-year and an all-time record. The performance was broad-based, with double-digit growth in the vast majority of the markets we track and double-digit growth across most of our services categories. Company gross margin was 47.2%, above the high end of our guidance range and up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by favorable mix. This includes approximately $1.1 billion of tariff-related costs, which is in line with what we had estimated on our last call. Products gross margin was 36.2%, up 170 basis points sequentially driven by favorable mix. Services gross margin was 75.3%, down 30 basis points sequentially. Operating expenses landed at $15.9 billion, up 11% year-over-year, driven by increased investment in R&D. These strong levels of business performance led to September quarter records for both net income and diluted earnings per share. Net income was $27.5 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.85, up 13% year-over-year on an adjusted basis, excluding the onetime charge we recognized during the fourth quarter of 2024. Operating cash flow was also a September quarter record at $29.7 billion. Now I'm going to provide some more details for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $49 billion, up 6% year-over-year, driven by the iPhone 16 family. iPhone grew in the vast majority of the markets we track with September quarter records in many emerging markets, including Latin America, the Middle East and South Asia and an all-time record in India. The iPhone active installed base grew to an all-time high, and we set a September quarter record for upgraders. According to the recent survey from World Panel, iPhone was a top-selling model in the U.S., Urban China, the U.K., France, Australia and Japan. We continue to see very high levels of customer satisfaction in the U.S. at 98% as measured by 451 Research. Mac revenue was $8.7 billion, up 13% year-over-year, driven by MacBook Air. We grew in every geographic segment with strong double-digit growth in emerging markets. The Mac installed base reached another all-time high with nearly half of customers who purchased a Mac being new to the product. And the latest customer satisfaction for Mac in the U.S. was reported at 96%. iPad revenue was $7 billion, flat year-over-year. Keep in mind, we faced a difficult compare against the full quarter impact of the iPad Air and iPad Pro launch from last year, offset by the better-than-expected performance on the iPad. The installed base reached an all-time high with a September quarter record for upgraders and over half of the customers who purchased an iPad during the quarter were new to the product. Based on the latest reports from 451 Research, customer satisfaction was 98% in the U.S. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $9 billion, flat year-over-year. This was driven by growth on Watch and AirPods, offset by accessories, which was impacted by strong performance in the year ago quarter, driven by the iPad launches. Both the Apple Watch and AirPods installed bases reached new all-time highs. Over half of the customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product, and we also set a September record for upgraders an Apple Watch. And in the U.S., customer satisfaction was recently measured at 95%. Our services revenue reached an all-time high of $28.8 billion, up 15% year-over-year. We achieved all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe, Japan and rest of Asia Pacific as well as a September quarter record in Greater China. The majority of categories saw a sequential acceleration. And as Tim mentioned, we set many all-time revenue records, including payment services, where we reached an all-time revenue record and saw a double-digit growth year-over-year on Apple Pay Active Users. This strong momentum in the September quarter drove our total fiscal year services revenue to surpass $100 billion, up 14% year-over-year and our best ever. The growth of our installed base of active devices continues to offer us great opportunities for the future. Customer engagement across our services offerings also continue to grow both transacting and paid accounts reached new all-time highs, and we continue to improve the quality and expand the reach of our services offerings. From additional markets for Apple Pay, now available in nearly 90 countries, to AppleCare One, a great new way to cover multiple Apple products in a single plan. Turning to enterprise. We are seeing an adoption of Apple products accelerate across industries to improve productivity and drive innovation. The BMW Group has been deploying tens of thousands of iPhones, including the factory employees to further strengthen its digital capabilities and advance innovation at the company. Capital One has expanded its Mac Choice program by adding thousands more MacBook Airs across its workforce. In the Czech Republic, its largest bank, [indiscernible], continues to invest in the Apple ecosystem with over 5,000 iPhones in addition to its existing thousands of iPads and Macs. And Purdue University has launched a spatial computing hub built around Vision Pro, designed to help prepare students to lead the next wave of innovation in critical industries like semiconductor and pharmaceutical manufacturing. Let's turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $132 billion in cash and marketable securities. We had $1.3 billion of debt maturities and decreased commercial paper by $1.9 billion, resulting in $99 billion in total debt. Therefore, at the end of the quarter, net cash was $34 billion. During the quarter, we returned $24 billion to shareholders. This included $3.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and $20 billion through open market repurchases of 89 million Apple shares. Taking a step back, we are very pleased with our record fiscal year 2025 results. As Tim mentioned, total company revenue for the year was $416 billion with growth in iPhone, Mac, iPad and Services and all-time records in the vast majority of markets we track. This revenue performance led to very strong full year operating results with all-time records for net income and for diluted EPS, which grew double digits year-over-year on an adjusted basis. As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information Suhasini referred to. Importantly, the color we're providing assumes that the global tariff rates, policies and application remain in effect as of this call and the global macroeconomic outlook does not worsen from today. We expect our December quarter total company revenue to grow by 10% to 12% year-over-year, which will be our best quarter ever. We expect iPhone revenue to grow double digits year-over-year, which would be our best iPhone quarter ever. On Mac, keep in mind, we expect to face a very difficult compare against the M4 MacBook Pro, Mac Mini and iMac launches in the year ago quarter. We expect services revenue to grow at a year-over-year rate similar to what we reported in the fiscal year 2025. We expect gross margin to be between 47% and 48%, which includes an estimated impact of $1.4 billion of tariff-related costs. And as we've said before, we are significantly increasing our investments in AI, while continuing to invest in our product road map. And so for the December quarter, we expect operating expenses to be between $18.1 billion and $18.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around $150 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 17%. Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.26 per share of common stock payable on November 13, 2025, to shareholders of record as of November 10, 2025. With that, let's open the call to questions."
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,4,Suhasini Chandramouli,"[Operator Instructions] Operator, may we have the first question, please?"
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,5,Operator,"Certainly, we will go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley."
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,6,Erik Woodring,"Congrats on the results. Tim, can you maybe share a bit more detail on why you think the iPhone 17 is having the degree of success that it is at this point. And really, the question is, do you believe this is the aged installed base replacement cycle kicking in? Or are there specific features or functionality you believe stand out this cycle versus past cycles that consumers are really looking for? And then just a quick follow-up."
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,7,Timothy Cook,"Eric, thanks for your comments. I think it's all about the product. The product lineup is incredibly strong, our strongest ever. The 17 Pro is the most pro phone we've ever done. It's incredible in the design things. The iPhone air is -- feels so thin and so light in your hand, it feels like it's going to fly away. And then the 17 phone is an incredible value and takes several of the features that were reserved for Pro before and brings them down to the consumer lineup. So overall, strongest iPhone lineup ever, and it's resonating around the world."
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,8,Erik Woodring,"Great. And maybe a follow-up for you, Kevan. Can you maybe just discuss your approach to managing component cost inflation during this time, you're obviously increasing the memory content in your devices quite substantially at the same time. Memory prices are going through some pretty significant inflation. So just how are you managing through this cycle."
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,9,Kevan Parekh,"Erik, thanks for the question. Look, as you know, we've got a pretty incredible world-class procurement team as we're constantly finding ways to continue to drive cost opportunities. Right now on the commodity side, I would say we're seeing a slight tailwind on memory in storage prices and nothing really to note there. And as we saw from our gross margin performance, we landed in a pretty good spot above the high end of the guidance range we provided at 47.2%. And as well, we're guiding at 47% to 48%. So I think we're managing costs pretty well. As you'll recall, when we talked about this time in the cycle, we just launched a bunch of new products. Those new products do have a slightly higher cost structure than the products they replace, but the team does a very good job of focusing our efforts on getting those costs down over time. And we feel pretty good about the performance we're seeing right now overall on material cost savings."
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,10,Suhasini Chandramouli,"Operator, can we get the next question, please?"
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,11,Operator,Our next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research.
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,12,Benjamin Reitzes,"Tim, can you talk a little bit about iPhone in China specifically? How is that going to trend in the December quarter? And have you turned the corner there? And how do you think that trajectory is going? And then I have a quick follow-up."
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,13,Timothy Cook,"Yes. Ben, I was just there. It's incredibly vibrant and dynamic. The store traffic is up significantly year-over-year. The iPhone 17 has been -- the family has been very well received there. We do believe that we'll return to growth in Q1, and that is largely based on the reception of the iPhone there. And so I couldn't be more pleased with how things are going there in the early going."
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,14,Benjamin Reitzes,"All right. That's great. And then services, great upside there, a little surprising, right? We were a little worried about that one only a few quarters ago. I was wondering if there were any [indiscernible] payments in there or if the resolution that we saw with the antitrust ruling with one of your partners was a boost and and if that played a role or if it was all really just organic outperformance with many of the things you mentioned."
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,15,Kevan Parekh,"Ben, it's Kevan here. Let me try to answer that question. You're referring -- I just wanted to clarify, when you're referring to the antitrust piece, you're talking about the Google trial? Is that what you're referring to?"
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,16,Benjamin Reitzes,"Yes. Yes, sir."
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,17,Kevan Parekh,"Okay. Yes, there was no tax-related impact. And what I would say is our strong performance for the quarter is really organically driven. And again, just to reiterate, we had an all-time revenue record here for the quarter at $28.8 billion. And as well, we surpassed $100 billion, so best year ever at 14% year-on-year. So really that was all organic growth. As Tim outlined and I outlined in the prepared remarks, we saw a majority of the categories have sequential acceleration, and we had many all-time revenue records. But nothing abnormal at all, really pretty much all organic growth."
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,18,Suhasini Chandramouli,"Operator, could we get the next question, please?"
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,19,Operator,Our next question is from Michael Ng.
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,20,Michael Ng,"I just have two as well. First, just to follow up on the last one. the services revenue growth, I think, was the fastest across many categories and certainly the fastest in the last 2 years. I was just wondering if you could just unpack a little bit more of the drivers of the acceleration, was there kind of cross-selling with the new iPhone launch? Was it just installed base growth? I know you've been doing a lot of bundling with Apple One and Apple Care One. So any thoughts on that would be very helpful. And then I just have a quick follow-up."
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,21,Kevan Parekh,"Michael, it's Kevan. Thanks for the question. Yes, let me build on the answer there. I think that the way we look at it is not one thing to point to that would have driven this higher performance. You're right that it is slightly higher than we've seen in the last few quarters. But as you know, our services portfolio is very broad with a broad range of businesses, all that have different growth profiles and different performance characteristics. So those can vary in any given quarter. I would say our strength, again, was very broad-based, both across categories and also geographically. So I wouldn't point to any particular factor that drove any kind of outperformance at all. We were just very pleased to see that result."
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,22,Michael Ng,"Great. And just on iPhone sell-through, I was wondering if you were seeing any notable shifts in trends between the sell-through coming from upgraders versus switchers? Is the U.S. carrier competitive dynamic helping at all in terms of promotional activity? And any thoughts on channel inventory."
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,23,Timothy Cook,"Okay. We did set a September quarter record for upgraders and so it was a great quarter from that point of view. It's really too early in the cycle on 17 to make any comments about upgraders or switchers. In terms of channel inventory, we ended the quarter toward the low end of the targeted range. Obviously, because we had constraints on several models of the 16 and 17. And for complete transparency and clarity, we're constrained today on several models of the iPhone 17. There's not a ramp issue. It's just we have very strong demand. And we're working very hard to fulfill all the orders that we have."
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,24,Suhasini Chandramouli,"Operator, could we get the next question, please."
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,25,Operator,Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,26,Amit Daryanani,"I guess Kevan, maybe just start with gross margins. Can you just walk through the expectations for the December quarter. I think it implies up 30 basis points or so sequentially. Can you just talk about the puts and takes on gross margin given you do have very sizable operating leverage in the quarter. So just maybe what are the puts and takes around that would be really helpful."
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,27,Kevan Parekh,"Yes, sure. Amit, let me walk through the outlook. As we mentioned in our outlook, we are targeting a range of 47% to 48%. You take the midpoint of that range at 47.5%, you said it's roughly 25 basis points, 30 basis points higher. Really, there's a lot of puts and takes. As I talked about earlier, this is a quarter we launched a lot of new products. Those new products tend to have a higher cost structure than the products they replaced. So there's definitely an impact from the cost side of thing, but that was more than offset by a favorable mix, especially on the product side as well as you outlined, we typically see higher leverage in this quarter. So I would say those are the 2 big drivers. And so the sequential increase is really going to be driven by favorable mix particularly from the product side."
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,28,Amit Daryanani,"Got it. And then if I just go back to the China discussion for a minute, the performance in China, at least in September quarter was a bit muted. Could you just talk about what resulted in the weakness over there? And do you think it was a bit more of a pause given iPhone Air, for example, I don't think was available until a few weeks ago. So just somewhat what drove the weakness in September? And is the uptick of that expectation for December there just from the iPhone Air coming out? Or are there other factors as well?"
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,29,Timothy Cook,"Yes. The Greater China revenue was down 4% in the -- year-over-year in the September quarter. It was driven by iPhone and if you look at the iPhone, the majority of the sequential year-over-year change was due to supply constraints that I mentioned earlier. And so it was basically supply constraints that drove the results. We're thrilled with what we're seeing right now with traffic being up significantly year-over-year and the reception of the 17 family we expect to return to growth this quarter."
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,30,Suhasini Chandramouli,"Operator, could we have the next question, please?"
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,31,Operator,Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,32,Wamsi Mohan,"Tim, if I can follow up on your comments about the constrained supply in the quarter, just given the very strong demand for iPhones. Do you expect that as you can see your visibility across demand and supply, do you think that you will be exiting December at a point where you wouldn't be constrained anymore? Or do you still expect that there could be constraints as you exit the December quarter? And any way to quantify sort of what revenue could have been in this quarter without constraints?"
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,33,Timothy Cook,"Yes. If you look at the supply constraints, today, we are constrained on several 17 models. We're not predicting when the supply/demand will balance. We're obviously working very hard to achieve that because we want to get as many of these products out to the customers as possible. But today, I'm not going to predict."
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,34,Wamsi Mohan,"Okay. Okay. And then as a follow-up, how do you talk about new records across a lot of categories and services. I didn't hear Search explicitly called out. So maybe it's a little bit of a follow-up to Ben's question, but given that there are some concerns around search volumes decelerating at the expense of AI. How do you think about the broader sustainability of these very strong mid-teens growth rates for services or an extended period of time, not just for next quarter where you're obviously guiding to [ 14 ]."
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,35,Timothy Cook,"This is Tim. The advertising category, which is a combination of third-party and first-party did set a record during the quarter."
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,36,Wamsi Mohan,"Okay. And sorry, just to be clear, both Apple's own internal advertising and within the licensing individually set records?"
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,37,Timothy Cook,Actually I'm not saying that. I'm just saying that the combination of the 2 set of record. We don't -- I'm dodging the question intentionally because we don't split it at that level.
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,38,Suhasini Chandramouli,"Operator, could we get the next question, please?"
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,39,Operator,Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,40,Samik Chatterjee,"Maybe for the first one, Tim, you talked about the strong momentum you're seeing in China, which is also driving your conference for the December quarter. Any thoughts on the role that the smartphone subsidies in that region are playing in this momentum? And how do you think about sort of what portion of consumers are maybe using some of those subsidies, leveraging the subsidies at this point? Any more insights into that? And I have a follow-up."
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,41,Timothy Cook,"Yes, the subsidies play a favorable role. The subsidies, as you know, are sort of across multiple categories from PCs to tablets, smart watches and smartphones. And however, it's important to note they only apply to certain price ranges. And so there's a maximum price, and there's several of our products that are -- that sell above that price and therefore, are not eligible for a subsidy, but it does have a favorable effect. And it's clearly and at least from our vantage point, driving some consumer demand."
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,42,Samik Chatterjee,"Okay. Got it. And a follow-up for Kevan here. On the OpEx increase going into the December quarter, a fairly sizable step-up. So if you could just dig into that number a bit more what are sort of the components towards what you're spending? And then that increase year-over-year in OpEx does sort of exceed your revenue growth. So is that sort of what we should expect on a going forward basis as well where you probably need to invest a bit more in the near future?"
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,43,Kevan Parekh,"Yes, Samik, thanks for that question. As we've been outlining and reiterated in our last call, we are increasing our investments in AI. We're also continuing to invest in our product road map. So the vast majority of the increase to our operating expenses are driven by R&D. While we continue to manage the company in a thoughtful and disciplined way, we're also managing the business for the long term and are super excited about all the opportunities that we see ahead. As it relates to the question around OpEx and revenue growth, while OpEx has been growing at a faster rate than revenue, we have seen gross margin expansion. And so when we look at that on a combined basis, it does allow us to have healthy operating leverage, and our operating income growth has been generally outpacing revenue growth for the past several years."
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,44,Suhasini Chandramouli,"Operator, could we get the next question, please?"
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,45,Operator,Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS.
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,46,David Vogt,"So maybe, Kevan, can I ask first. Can you help us understand sort of the tariff impact sequentially from the September quarter to the December quarter, particularly around iPhone supply constraints because I think I heard you say tariffs go from $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion, but the sequential uplift in iPhone revenue and presumably production given supply chain constraints is dramatically bigger. So you can help us understand how to think about the timing of those tariff headwinds as we move forward and sort of that correlation? And then I have a follow-up."
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,47,Timothy Cook,"David, I'll take this one. You're right, it goes from $1.1 billion to a projection of $1.4 billion. And the $1.4 billion is based on sort of what we know right now and where the tariff rates and policies and so forth are. So it assumes a stable kind of environment for the quarter. It does comprehend the change that was just made, which we're very encouraged to see with the tariffs moving from 20% to 10% in China. And so that is factored in. And that is one of the reasons why the it's not linear to volume, if you will. Does that make sense?"
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,48,David Vogt,"No, that's helpful. That's what I was asking if the change is reflected in that outlook. And then just as a follow-up, when you think about -- I think on the Macs, I know people aren't asking about it, you talked about the tough comp, but you're going into sort of a holiday season, I understand that. But when you think about the attached possibility for other products to the iPhone in the holiday season, how do we think about sort of where the consumers heads that and their wallet is at this point in the cycle and granted it is a tough comp, but is there an opportunity to see some maybe upside from an attach rate perspective given the strength in the iPhone portfolio?"
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,49,Timothy Cook,"We always like to remind people that buy an iPhone, all the other things that we offer. And so you can bet that we're doing that. From a Mac point of view, the challenges that last year was sort of the mother of all Mac launches. All of these from Mac mini to iMac to all the Macbook Pros, all launched literally at the same time. And this year, that compares to launching the 14-inch MacBook Pro. And so there's a very difficult compare. Of course, in the long run, I'm very bullish on the Mac. And you can see that the Mac again last quarter outgrew the market. And so we feel really well about how Mac is positioned, but this certain quarter is an extremely difficult compare."
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,50,Kevan Parekh,"Yes. And Tim, I'll add to that, that we also have the DRAM upgrades last year for the Mac lineup also is another factor."
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,51,Suhasini Chandramouli,"Operator, could we get the next question, please?"
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,52,Operator,Our next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen.
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,53,Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan,My first one is on the iPhone constraints. Is there a way to quantify how much this is you left on the table because of those constraints? And is the different iPhone manufacturing from 2 different regions contributing to the constraint? And then I have a follow-up for you.
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,54,Timothy Cook,"To be clear, the constraint was not related to manufacturing capacity per se. It was that we called the number of iPhone 16s that we were going to make, and we're a bit short of where the demand really was. So we could have sold more. We're not publicly at least estimating the extent of that. And then on iPhone 17 family, the demand is very strong. And so we obviously came out of the Q4 time frame with lots of back orders."
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,55,Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan,"Got it. And then a quick follow-up. Given like the prevalence of chatbots and now some of these AI-infused services, do you think that could change the consumer behavior on mobile app ecosystems or are you seeing any of that? And would that have any impact on your App Store?"
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,56,Timothy Cook,"I think there are opportunities on the App Store with artificial intelligence. And so I think as we have made our on-device models available for developers, and we've seen developers begin to adopt them and so I think as you -- as that proliferates, there's an opportunity to -- for developers and for Apple to benefit from that from adding features to their apps and so forth."
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,57,Suhasini Chandramouli,"Operator, could we get the next question, please?"
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,58,Operator,Our next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,59,Aaron Rakers,"I have two as well. I guess the first question is when we look at the iPhone 17 demand, which you've repeatedly highlighted is very strong. I'm curious if there's been any discernible kind of change in the mix within the iPhone 17 categories between the Pro and the Pro Max versions relative to prior cycles?"
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,60,Timothy Cook,"It's really too early to call the mix, to be honest. And we don't like to publicly disclose that because of -- for competitive reasons. But frankly, we don't really know what the mix will be yet because we have constraints on both sides of the ledger at the top and at the entry. And so we'll see what happens as we get more supply."
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,61,Aaron Rakers,"Yes. And then as a quick follow-up. I'm curious, as we kind of work through kind of the AI narrative that continues to build. Is there -- could you provide any kind of updated thoughts around the build-out of Apple's private compute cloud and how we should think about that kind of as we look forward?"
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,62,Timothy Cook,"Yes. We're obviously using PCC, our private cloud compute today for a number of queries for Siri, and we will continue to build it out. In fact, the manufacturing plant that makes the servers used for Apple Intelligence just started manufacturing in Houston a few weeks ago, and we've got a ramp plan there for use in our data centers and it's robust."
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,63,Kevan Parekh,"Yes. Aaron, I'll add maybe there are two since you asked a question about private cloud compute that we -- in '25, we did have CapEx costs associated with building out our private cloud compute environment in our first-party data centers. So you would have seen that in some of the CapEx investment in the year."
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,64,Suhasini Chandramouli,"Operator, can we get the next question, please?"
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,65,Operator,Our next question is from Atif Malik with Citi.
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,66,Atif Malik,Great execution. The first question is on iPhone Air. Does the consumer reception and iPhone Air gives you a feel on perhaps the foldable corn market? Or are the 2 form factors very different?
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,67,Timothy Cook,"I'm not sure that that one is a proxy for the other. The thing that I would say is that where we don't get into the model kind of demand. At the aggregate level, we are thrilled with how iPhone has been received, and that's the reason that we're expecting double-digit growth in the current quarter."
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,68,Atif Malik,"Great. And Tim, as a follow-up, good to know that the personalized Siri is making good progress and on track for next year. Will you continue to use a 3-pronged approach with your own foundation models and partner with other LLM providers and maybe potential M&A? Or is one strategy more emphasized over another?"
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,69,Timothy Cook,"We're obviously creating Apple Foundation models within Apple. We ship them on device and use them in the private cloud compute as well. And we've got several in development. And so we also, from a continually to surveil the market on M&A and are open to pursuing M&A if we think that it will advance our road map."
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,70,Suhasini Chandramouli,"Operator, can we get our last question, please?"
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,71,Operator,Our last question is from Richard Kramer with Arete Research.
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,72,Richard Kramer,"Tim, we've often seen Apple be a fast follower with iPhone and new technology, whether large displays or 4G or 5G. But with all the height now around AI, are you seeing evidence that AI capabilities or features are a material purchase consideration for consumers or the record sales levels you're reporting simply reflecting other factors like the retention of your iOS space?"
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,73,Timothy Cook,"I think that there are many factors that influence people's purchasing considerations. And so -- and we don't have a great in-depth survey yet on the current iPhone 17 because it's very new in the cycle, and we give it some time to formulate. But I would say that Apple Intelligence is a factor. And we're very bullish on it becoming a greater factor and so that's the way that we look at it."
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,74,Richard Kramer,"Okay. And then one for Kevan. In the wake of nearly every other large tech company massively increasing their CapEx in advance of AI demand and also mentioning that there's scarce capacity, do you anticipate Apple altering its sort of long-standing hybrid approach to your own and third-party data centers? And maybe can you talk a little bit about the role you see for Apple silicon with the new M5 series of chipsets?"
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,75,Kevan Parekh,"Richard, thanks for the question. In general, I think as we've talked about before, we are expecting increases in our CapEx spending related to AI investments. For example, as I mentioned earlier, we did end up having investments this year to build out our private cloud compute environment. And we do believe this hybrid model has served us very well, and we continue to want to leverage it. And so I don't see us moving away from this hybrid model where we leverage both first-party capacity as well as leverage third-party capacity. We'll continue to want to build out private cloud compute, as Tim outlined, as we have more usage there over time. But I think in general, we want to continue to have this hybrid model."
6d5cbaa142801006089c1e9258af8f18,76,Suhasini Chandramouli,"A replay of today's call will be available for 2 weeks on Apple podcast as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya."
493580,3,Satya Nadella,"Thank you, Brett. This quarter we saw continued strength in Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $40 billion in revenue for the first time, up 21% year-over-year. Enterprises are beginning to move from proof-of-concepts to enterprise-wide deployments to unlock the full ROI of AI. And our AI business has now surpassed an annual revenue run rate of $13 billion up 175% year-over-year. Before I get into the details of the quarter, I want to comment on the core thesis behind our approach to how we manage our fleet and how we allocate our capital to compute. AI scaling laws are continuing to compound across both pre-training and inference time compute. We ourselves have been seeing significant efficiency gains in both training and inference for years now. On inference, we have typically seen more than 2x price performance gain for every hardware generation and more than 10x for every model generation due to software optimizations. And as AI becomes more efficient and accessible, we will see exponentially more demand. Therefore, much as we have done with the Commercial Cloud, we are focused on continuously scaling our fleet globally and maintaining the right balance across training and inference as well as geo distribution. From now on it's a more continuous cycle governed by both revenue growth and capability growth, thanks to the compounding effects of software driven AI scaling laws and Moore's Law. With that, I will walk through the progress we are making across every layer of the tech stack. Azure is the infrastructure layer for AI. We continue to expand our data center capacity in line with both near-term and long-term demand signals. We have more than doubled our overall data center capacity in the last three years and we have added more capacity last year than any other year in our history. Our data centers, networks, racks and silicon are all coming together as a complete system to drive new efficiencies to power both the cloud workloads of today and the next generation AI workloads. We continue to take advantage of Moore's Law and refresh our fleet as evidenced by our support of the latest from AMD, Intel, NVIDIA as well as our first-party silicon innovation from Maia, Cobalt, Boost and HSM. When it comes to cloud migrations, we continue to see customers like UBS move workloads to Azure. UBS alone migrated mainframe workloads encompassing nearly 400 billion records and 2 petabytes of data. And we remain the cloud of choice for customers' mission-critical Oracle, SAP and VMware apps. At the data layer, we are seeing Microsoft Fabric breakout. We now have over 19,000 paid customers from Hitachi to Johnson Controls to Schaeffler. Fabric is now the fastest growing analytics product in our history. Power BI is also deeply integrated with Fabric with over 30 million monthly active users, up 40% since last year. Beyond Fabric, we are seeing new AI-driven data patterns emerge. If you look underneath ChatGPT or Copilot or Enterprise AI apps, you see the growth of raw storage, database services and app platform services as these workloads scale. The number of Azure OpenAI apps running on Azure databases and Azure app services more than doubled year-over-year driving significant growth and adoption across SQL Hyperscale and Cosmos DB. Now on to AI platform and tools, as we shared last week we are thrilled OpenAI has made a new large Azure commitment. Through our strategic partnership we continue to benefit mutually from each other's growth and with OpenAI's APIs exclusively running on Azure customers can count on us to get access to the world's leading models and OpenAI has a lot more coming soon, so stay tuned. Azure AI Foundry features best-in-class tooling, run times to build agents, multi-agent apps, AI ops, API access to thousands of models. Two months in, we already have more than 200,000 monthly active users and we are well positioned with our support of both OpenAI's leading models and the best selection of Open Source models and SLMs. DeepSeek's R1 launched today via the model catalog on Foundry and GitHub with automated red teaming, content safety integration and security scanning. Our Phi family of SLMs has now been downloaded over 20 million times and we also have more than 30 models from partners like Bayer, Paige.AI, Rockwell Automation, Siemens to address industry specific use cases. With AI, how we build, deploy and maintain code is fundamentally changing. And GitHub Copilot is increasingly the tool of choice for both digital natives like ASOS and Spotify as well as world's largest enterprises like HP, HSBC and KPMG. We've been delighted by the early response to GitHub Copilot and VS Code with more than a million sign ups in just the first week post launch. All up GitHub now is home to 150 million developers up 50% over the past two years. Now on to the future of work. Microsoft 365 Copilot is the UI for AI. It helps supercharge employee productivity and provides access to a swarm of intelligent agents to streamline employee workflow. We are seeing accelerated customer adoption across all deal sizes as we win new Microsoft 365 Copilot customers and see the majority of existing enterprise customers come back to purchase more seats. When you look at customers who purchased Copilot during the first quarter of availability, they have expanded their seats collectively by more than 10x over the past 18 months. To share just one example, Novartis has added thousands of seats each quarter over the past year and now have 40,000 seats. Barclays, Carrier Group, Pearson and University of Miami all purchased 10,000 or more seats this quarter. And overall the number of people who use Copilot daily again more than doubled quarter-over-quarter. Employees are also engaging with Copilot more than ever. Usage intensity increased more than 60% quarter-over-quarter and we are expanding our TAM with Copilot Chat which was announced earlier this month. Copilot Chat along with Copilot Studio is now available to every employee to start using agents right in the flow of work. With Copilot Studio, we are making it as simple to build an agent as it is to create an Excel spreadsheet. More than 160,000 organizations have already used Copilot Studio and they collectively created more than 400,000 custom agents in the last three months alone up over 2x quarter-over-quarter. We've also introduced our own first-party agents to facilitate meetings, manage projects, resolve common HR and IT queries and access SharePoint data. And we also continue to see partners like Adobe, SAP, ServiceNow and Workday build their third-party agents and integrate with Copilot. What is driving Copilot as the UI for AI as well as our momentum with agents is our rich data cloud which is the world's largest source of organizational knowledge. Billions of emails, documents and chats, hundreds of millions of teams meetings and millions of SharePoint sites are added each day. This is the Enterprise Knowledge Cloud. It is growing fast up over 25% year-over-year. More broadly what we are seeing is Copilot plus agents disrupting business applications and we are leaning into this. With Dynamics 365, we took share as organizations like Ecolab, Lenovo, RTX, Total Energies, and Vizient switched to our AI powered apps from legacy providers. In Healthcare, DAX Copilot surpassed 2 million monthly physician patient encounters up 54% quarter-over-quarter. It is being used by top providers like Mass General Brigham, Michigan Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center to increase productivity of their physicians. When it comes to Windows, we are seeing momentum build as we approach end of support for Windows 10. Customers are choosing the latest Windows 11 devices for their enhanced security and advanced AI capabilities. 15% of premium priced laptops in the US this holiday were Copilot+ PCs and we expect the majority of the PCs sold in the next several years to be Copilot+ PCs. We also see more and more developments from Adobe and CapCut to WhatsApp build apps that leverage built-in NPUs. And they will soon be able to run DeepSeek's R1 distilled models locally on Copilot+ PCs as well as the vast ecosystem of GPUs available on Windows. And beyond Copilot+ PCs the most powerful AI workstation for local development is a Windows PC running WSL 2 powered by NVIDIA RTX GPUs. Now on to Security. We continue to make progress with our Secure Future initiative and we are applying what we have learned introducing over 80 new product capabilities over the past year. With Security Copilot organizations across private and public sector like City of Johannesburg, Eastman, Intesa, National Australia Bank, NTT can resolve incidents 30% faster. Data governance is increasingly critical and customers now use Microsoft Purview to audit over 2 billion Copilot interactions for safe and compliant use. Now on to our consumer businesses starting with LinkedIn. More professionals than ever are engaging in high value conversations on LinkedIn with comments up 37% year-over-year. Short form video continues to grow on the platform with video creation all up growing at twice the rate of other post formats. We're also innovating with agents to help recruiters and small businesses find qualified candidates faster and our hiring business again took share. In subscriptions, LinkedIn premiums surpassed $2 billion in annual revenue for the first time this quarter. Subscriber growth has increased nearly 50% over the past two years and nearly 40% of subscribers have used our AI features to improve their profiles. And LinkedIn marketing solution remains the leader in B2B advertising. Now on to Search Advertising and News. We once again took share across Bing and Edge. Edge surpassed 30% market share in the US on Windows and has taken share for 15 consecutive quarters. The investments we have made in improving our ad rates are paying off and advertisers increasingly see our network as an essential platform to optimize ROI. And our Copilot consumer app is seeing increased engagement and retention with its improved speed, unique personality, first of its kind features like Copilot Vision. Just today we made Think Deeper powered by o1, free for all Copilot users globally. Now on to gaming, we are focused on improving the profitability of the business in order to position it for long-term growth driven by higher margin content and platform services and we are delivering on this plan. Black Ops 6 was top selling game on Xbox and PlayStation this quarter and saw more players in its launch quarter than any other paid release in the franchise history. And we saw rave reviews of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle which has already been played by more than 4 million people. We also continue to see strong momentum for Xbox Cloud Gaming with a record 140 million hours streamed this quarter. All-up Game Pass set a new quarterly record for revenue and grew its PC subscriber base by over 30% as we focus on driving fully paid subscribers across endpoints. In closing, we continue to innovate across our tech stack to help our customers in this AI era and I'm energized by the many opportunities ahead. With that, let me turn it over to Amy."
493580,4,Amy Hood,"Thank you, Satya and good afternoon everyone. This quarter revenue was $69.6 billion up 12%. Gross margin dollars increased 13% and 12% in constant currency, while operating income increased 17% and 16% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $3.23 an increase of 10%. We delivered another quarter of double-digit top and bottom line growth. Results were driven by strong demand for our cloud and AI offerings, while we also improved our operating leverage with higher than expected operating income growth. As you heard from Satya, our AI business annual revenue run rate surpassed $13 billion and was above expectations. Commercial bookings increased 67% and 75% in constant currency and were significantly ahead of expectations driven by Azure commitments from OpenAI. Execution was strong across our core annuity sales motions with growth in the number of $100 million plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased to $298 billion, up 34% and 36% in constant currency. Roughly 40% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 21% year-over-year. The remaining portion recognized beyond the next 12 months increased 45%. And this quarter, our annuity mix was 97%. FX did not have a significant impact on our results and was roughly in line with expectations on total company revenue, More Personal Computing revenue, total company COGS, and operating expense. FX decreased revenue more than expected in our commercial segments. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $40.9 billion and grew 21%. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage was 70%, in line with expectations and decreased two points year-over-year driven by scaling our AI infrastructure. Company gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year to 69% primarily driven by sales mix shift to higher margin businesses as well as improvement in Gaming and Search, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 5%, lower than expected, and operating margins increased two points year-over-year to 45%. The better than expected margin expansion was driven by delivering efficiencies across our businesses as we invest to scale AI infrastructure and build AI applications. At a total company level, headcount at the end of December was 2% higher than a year ago and was relatively unchanged from last quarter. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $29.4 billion and grew 14% and 13% in constant currency even with the unfavorable FX impact noted earlier. Results were ahead of expectations driven by Microsoft 365 Commercial. Microsoft 365 Commercial Cloud revenue increased 16% and 15% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations due to better than expected performance in E5 and Microsoft 365 Copilot. With M365 Copilot, we continue to see growth in adoption, expansion, and usage. ARPU growth was again driven by E5 and M365 Copilot. Paid M365 Commercial seats grew 7% year-over-year with installed base expansion across all customer segments, though primarily in our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. M365 commercial products revenue increased 13%, significantly ahead of expectations driven by higher than expected transactional purchasing with the launch of Office 2024 as well as the Windows Commercial on-premises components from the better than expected performance of M365 suites noted earlier. M365 Consumer Cloud revenue increased 8%, slightly ahead of expectations. We saw continued momentum in M365 consumer subscriptions which grew 10% to 86.3 million with mix shift to M365 Basic. LinkedIn revenue increased 9% with continued growth across all lines of business. In our Talent Solutions business, results were slightly below expectations driven by continued weakness in the hiring market in key verticals. Dynamics 365 revenue increased 19% and 18% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations with growth across all workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and 12% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year driven by scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 6% and operating income increased 16% and 15% in constant currency. Next the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $25.5 billion and grew 19% with more unfavorable FX impact than expected. Excluding the unfavorable FX impact, results in Azure non-AI services, on-prem server, and enterprise and partner services were slightly lower than expected, partially offset by better than expected results in Azure AI services. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 31%. Azure growth included 13 points from AI services, which grew 157% year-over-year and was ahead of expectations even as demand continued to be higher than our available capacity. Growth in our non-AI services was slightly lower than expected due to go-to-market execution challenges, particularly with our customers that we primarily reach through our scale motions, as we balance driving near-term non-AI consumption with AI growth. In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 3%, slightly below expectations driven by slower than expected purchasing around Windows Server 2025 launch. Enterprise and Partner Services revenue decreased 1%, below expectations with lower than expected performance across Enterprise Support Services and Industry Solutions. Segment gross margin dollars increased 12% and 13% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased four points year-over-year driven by scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 10% and operating income grew 14%. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $14.7 billion, relatively unchanged year-over-year with better than expected results driven primarily by Windows OEM pre-builds, usage from a third-party partnership in Search, as well as Call of Duty launch performance in Gaming. Windows OEM and Devices revenue increased 4% year-over-year, ahead of expectations, driven by commercial inventory builds in advance of Windows 10 end of support as well as uncertainty around tariffs. Search and News advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 21% and 20% in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by usage from a third-party partnership. Growth continues to be driven by rate expansion and healthy volume growth in both Edge and Bing. And in Gaming, revenue decreased 7% and 8% in constant currency as content and services growth continued to be offset by hardware declines. Xbox content and services revenue increased 2%, ahead of expectations driven by stronger than expected performance in Blizzard and Activision content, including Call of Duty. Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and 12% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased six points year-over-year driven by sales mix shift to higher margin businesses as well as strong execution on margin improvement in Gaming and Search. Operating expenses decreased 1%. Operating income increased 32% and 30% in constant currency driven by continued prioritization of higher margin opportunities. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were $22.6 billion, in line with expectations, and cash paid for PP&E was $15.8 billion. More than half of our cloud and AI related spend was on long-lived assets that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond. The remaining cloud and AI spend was primarily for servers, both CPUs and GPUs, to serve customers based on demand signals including our customer contracted backlog. Cash flow from operations was $22.3 billion, up 18% driven by strong cloud billings and collections, partially offset by higher supplier, employee and tax payments. Free cash flow was $6.5 billion, down 29% year-over-year, reflecting the capital expenditures noted earlier. This quarter, other income and expense was negative $2.3 billion, lower than our October guidance due to the impairment charge from our Cruise investment. Our effective tax rate came in slightly lower than anticipated at 18%. And finally, we returned $9.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now, moving to our Q3 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a US dollar basis. First, FX. With the strengthening of the US dollar since October, we now expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by two points. Within the segments, we expect FX to decrease revenue growth by two points in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and roughly one point in More Personal Computing. When compared to our October guidance assumptions on Q3 FX impact, this is a decrease to total revenue of roughly $1 billion. We expect FX to decrease COGS growth by approximately two points and operating expense growth by approximately one point. Our outlook has many of the trends we saw in Q2 continue through Q3. Demand for our differentiated cloud and AI offerings across the Microsoft Cloud should drive another quarter of strong growth. In Commercial Bookings, with a relatively flat expiry base and a strong prior year comparable in terms of large Azure contracts, we expect growth to be roughly flat year-over-year. We expect consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions and continued long-term commitments to our platform. As a reminder, larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 69%, down year-over-year driven by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes we expect revenue to grow between 11% and 12% in constant currency or $29.4 billion to $29.7 billion. Microsoft 365 Commercial Cloud revenue growth should be between 14% and 15% in constant currency, relatively stable compared to our better than expected Q2 results. We expect continued ARPU growth through E5 and M365 Copilot and we again expect some seat growth moderation given the size of the installed base. For M365 Commercial products, we expect revenue to be relatively unchanged year-over-year. As a reminder, M365 Commercial products include Windows Commercial on-premises components of M365 suites, so our quarterly revenue growth can have variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. M365 Consumer Cloud revenue growth should be in the mid to high-single-digits driven by M365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single-digits. Although we expect growth across all businesses, the Q2 trends in Talent Solutions should continue in Q3 as a headwind to growth. And in Dynamics 365, we expect revenue growth to be in the mid-teens driven by continued growth across all workloads. For Intelligent Cloud we expect revenue to grow between 19% and 20% in constant currency or $25.9 billion to $26.2 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q3 revenue growth to be between 31% and 32% in constant currency driven by strong demand for our portfolio of services. As we shared in October, the contribution from our AI services will grow from increased AI capacity coming online. In non-AI services healthy growth continues, although we expect ongoing impact through H2 as we work to address the execution challenges noted earlier. And while we expect to be AI capacity constrained in Q3, by the end of FY25 we should be roughly in line with near-term demand given our significant capital investments. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid-single-digits driven by a decrease in transactional purchasing. And in Enterprise and Partner services, we expect revenue growth to be in the low to mid-single-digits. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to be $12.4 billion to $12.8 billion with continued prioritization of higher margin opportunities. Windows OEM and Devices revenue should decline in the low to mid-single-digits. We expect revenue from Windows OEM to be relatively flat year-over-year as our outlook assumes inventory levels will normalize. Actual results may differ based on current tariff uncertainties. Devices revenue will decline. Search and News advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be in the mid-teens from continued growth in both volume and revenue per search with share gains across Edge and Bing. Growth is expected to moderate from last quarter primarily due to additional FX impact and as the third-party partnership usage noted earlier returns to more normal levels. Search ex-TAC growth will be higher than overall Search and News advertising revenue growth, which we expect to be in the mid to high-single-digits. And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth to be in the low-single-digits. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth to be in the low to mid-single-digits driven by first-party content as well as Xbox Game Pass. Hardware revenue will decline year-over-year. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS to grow between 19% and 20% in constant currency or to be between $21.65 billion to $21.85 billion and operating expense to grow between 5% and 6% in constant currency or to be between $16.4 billion and $16.5 billion. Other income and expense is expected to be roughly negative $1 billion primarily driven by investments accounted for under the equity method. As a reminder, we do not recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on equity method investments. And lastly, we expect our Q3 effective tax rate to be approximately 18%. Now some additional thoughts on the rest of the fiscal year and beyond. First, FX. With the strengthening of the US dollar since October, we now expect FX to decrease Q4 revenue and COGS growth by more than one point and operating expense growth by roughly one point. Next, capital expenditures. We expect quarterly spend in Q3 and Q4 to remain at similar levels as our Q2 spend. In FY26, we expect to continue investing against strong demand signals including customer contracted backlog we need to deliver against across the entirety of our Microsoft Cloud. However, the growth rate will be lower than FY25 and the mix of spend will begin to shift back to short-lived assets which are more correlated to revenue growth. As a reminder, our long-lived infrastructure investments are fungible, enabling us to remain agile as we meet customer demand globally across our Microsoft Cloud including AI workloads. As always, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure build-outs and the timing of delivery of finance leases. For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect double-digit revenue and operating income growth as we focus on delivering efficiencies across both COGS and operating expense. And given the operating leverage that we've delivered throughout the year, inclusive of efficiency gains as we scale our AI infrastructure and utilize our own AI solutions, we now expect FY25 operating margins to be up slightly year-over-year. And finally, our FY25 full year effective tax rate should be between 18% and 19%. In closing, we are committed to delivering real world AI solutions that help customers grow and improve their results. We are confident in our leadership position as we grow with our customers. Before turning to Q&A, I have one special thank you. Brett Iversen is moving to a new role here as the Head of our Americas sales finance team. On behalf of the company, thank you for your tremendous impact leading Investor Relations for the past four years and for the partnership with both Satya and me. And I'd like to welcome Jonathan Neilson, the former Head of Finance for our Security products, who is returning to Investor Relations to lead the team. With that, let's go to Q&A, Brett."
493580,5,Brett Iversen,"Thanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?"
493580,6,Operator,Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
493580,7,Keith Weiss,"Hi. Thank you guys for taking the question. And echoing Amy's comments, Brett, congratulations on the new role. It's been a pleasure working with you and best of luck in that new role. Looking at the quarter, another really solid quarter when it comes to commercial bookings. But again, we were a little disappointed on Azure coming in at the bottom end of the guidance range. Amy, I was hoping you could dig into perhaps what some of those execution issues were, what the resolution to those issues were. And do we still feel comfortable in the acceleration into the back half of the year that you were talking about after the June quarter and after last quarter? Thank you very much."
493580,8,Amy Hood,"Thanks, Keith. Let me spend a little time on that about what we saw in Q2 and give you some additional background on the near-term execution issues that we're talking about. First, let me be very specific. They are in the non-AI ACR component. Our Azure AI results were better than we thought due to very good work by the operating teams pulling in some delivery dates even by weeks. When your capacity constrained weeks matter, and it was good execution by the team, and you see that in the revenue results. On the non-AI side, really, the challenges were in what we call the scale motion. So think about primarily these are customers we reach through partners and through more indirect methods of selling. And really, the art form there is as these customers, which we reach in this way, are trying to balance how do you do an AI workload with continuing some of the work they've done on migrations and other fundamentals, we then took our sales motions in the summer and really change to try to balance those two. As you do that, you learn with your customers and with your partners on sort of getting that balance right between where to put our investments, where to put the marketing dollars and importantly, where to put people in terms of coverage and being able to help customers make those transitions. And I think we are going to make some adjustments to make sure we are in balance because when you make those changes in the summer, by the time it works its way through the system, you can see the impacts on whether you have that balance right. And so the teams are working through that. They're already making adjustments. And I expect, while, we will see some impact through H2 just because when you work through the scale motion, it can take some time for that to adjust. I feel good that the teams understand and are working through that. So hopefully that's just helpful on that. Then we talked a little bit about Q3. And so we've talked about 31% to 32% after publishing a 31% this quarter. Our AI results that we had felt good about and talked about our ability to land that revenue is the same. So again, in Q3, we are working from a pretty constrained capacity place. And that's no different than it was our expectation to be in that position last October when I talked to you all. And when I talk about being at a capacity constraint, it takes two things. You have to have space, which I generally call long-lived assets, right, that's the infrastructure and the land and then you have to have kits. We're continuing and you've seen that's why our spend has pivoted this way to be in the long-lived investment. We have been short, power and space. And so as you see those investments land that we've made over the past three years, we get closer to that balance by the end of this year. And so the confidence on the AI side continues to be there in terms of being able to sell, utilize and be, I think, encouraged by the signals. What we're seeing is waiting to see just how the non-AI ACR works through the scale motions in H2. But in general, the only thing that's changed is really that scale motion from my seat, Keith. Hope that's helpful. Satya?"
493580,9,Satya Nadella,"Yes. I think, Amy, just one thing I'd add, Keith, to your question is, as Amy said, the AI growth rate is actually better than what we expected, and we work through some of the supply stuff and more importantly, some of the workloads are scaling well. And when you look underneath any of these AI workloads, the other thing that is good is the ratio even what we would call just regular storage, data services, app services. So underneath a ChatGPT or a Copilot or even the emerging AI workloads in the enterprise. So that's all good. The enterprise workloads, whether it's SAP or whether it's VMware migrations, what have you, that's also in good shape. And it's just the scale place where Amy talked about this nuance, right, how do you really tweak the incentives, go-to-market at a time of platform shifts, you kind of want to make sure you lean into even the new design wins, and you just don't keep doing the stuff that you did in the previous generation. And that's the art form Amy was referencing to make sure you get the right balance. But let me put it this way. You would rather win the new than just protect the past. And that's sort of another thing that we definitely will lean into always."
493580,10,Keith Weiss,Excellent.
493580,11,Brett Iversen,"Thanks, Keith. Operator, next question please."
493580,12,Operator,The next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.
493580,13,Mark Moerdler,Thank you very much for taking my question. Can you give more color on what drove the far larger than expected Microsoft AI revenue. We talked a bit about the Azure AI component of it. But can you give more color on that? And our estimates are that the Copilot was much bigger than we had expected and growing much faster. Any more details on the breakdown of what that Microsoft AI would be great? Thanks.
493580,14,Amy Hood,"Thanks, Mark, for the question. Yes, that was, as we talked about better than expected. A couple of pieces to that, which you've correctly identified. Number one is the Azure component we just talked about. And the second piece, you're right, Microsoft Copilot was better. And what was important about that it was -- we saw strength both in seats, both new seats and expansion seats, as Satya talked about, and usage, which doesn't directly impact revenue, but of course, indirectly does as people get more and more value on it. And also price per seat was actually quite good. We still have a good signal for value. So those are the biggest pieces, Mark, of that sort of outperformance in terms of our expectations."
493580,15,Mark Moerdler,Thank you.
493580,16,Brett Iversen,"Thanks, Mark. Operator, next question please."
493580,17,Operator,The next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed.
493580,18,Brent Thill,"Thanks. Satya, you mentioned DeepSeek a couple of times in your prepared remarks. I think everyone would love your thoughts on what you're seeing there. And are we seeing AI scale now at lower cost? Are we reaching a mark where you can see that or do we still have some time to go? Thanks for your thoughts on this."
493580,19,Satya Nadella,"Yes. Thanks, Brent. So, yes, in my remarks, I talked about how in some sense, what's happening with AI is no different than what was happening with the regular compute cycle. It's always about bending the curve and then putting more points up the curve. So there's Moore's Law that's working in hyperdrive. Then on top of that, there is the AI scaling laws, both the pre-training and the inference time compute that compound and that's all software. You should think of what I said in my remarks, which we have observed for a while, which is 10x on improvements per cycle just because of all the software optimizations on inference. And so that's what you see. And then to that, I think DeepSeek has had some real innovations. And that is some of the things that even OpenAI found in o1. And so we are going to, obviously, now that all gets commoditized, and it's going to get broadly used. And the big beneficiaries of any software cycle like that is the customers, right. Because at the end of the day, if you think about it, right, what was the big lesson learned from client server to cloud, more people bought servers except it was called cloud. And so when token prices fall, infants computing prices fall, that means people can consume more, and there'll be more apps written. And it's interesting to see that when I referenced these models that are pretty powerful, it's unimaginable to think that here we are in sort of beginning of '25 where on the PC, you can run a model that required pretty massive cloud infrastructure. So that type of optimizations means AI will be much more ubiquitous. And so therefore, for a hyperscaler like us, a PC platform provider like us, this is all good news as far as I'm concerned."
493580,20,Brent Thill,Thank you.
493580,21,Brett Iversen,"Thanks, Brent. Operator, next question please."
493580,22,Operator,The next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed.
493580,23,Karl Keirstead,"Thank you. Maybe this one as well for Satya and it's also away from the numbers. But Satya, I wanted to ask you about the Stargate news and the announced changes in the OpenAI relationship last week. It seems that most of your investors have interpreted this as Microsoft, for sure, remaining very committed to OpenAI's success. But electing to take more of a backseat in terms of funding OpenAI's future training CapEx needs. I was hoping you might frame your strategic decision here around Stargate, and Amy, whether there's any takeaway for investors from that decision in terms of how you're thinking about CapEx needs over the next several years. Thank you."
493580,24,Satya Nadella,"Yes. Thanks for the question. So we remain very happy with the partnership with OpenAI. And as you saw, they have committed in a big way to Azure and even in the bookings what we recognize is just the first tranche of it. And so you'll see given the ROFR we have more benefits of that even into the future. And obviously, their success is our success because even all the other commercial arrangements that we detailed out in the blog that we put out even commensurate with that announcement. But to your overall point, the thing that I would say is we are building a pretty fungible fleet, right. We're making sure that there's the right balance between training and inference. It's geo distributed. We are working super hard on all the software oppositions, right. I mean just not the software optimizations that come because of what DeepSeek has done, but all the work we have done to, for example, reduce the prices of GPT models, over the years in partnership with OpenAI. In fact, we did a lot of the work on the inference optimizations on it and that's been key to driving, right. One of the key things to note in AI is you just don't launch the frontier model, but if it's too expensive to serve, it's no good, right. It won't generate any demand. So you've got to have that optimization, so that inferencing costs are coming down and they can be consumed broadly. And so that's the fleet physics we are managing. And also, remember, you don't want to buy too much of anything at one time because the Moore's Law every year is going to give you 2x, your optimization is going to give you 10x. You want to continuously upgrade the fleet, modernize the fleet, age, the fleet, and at the end of the day, have the right ratio of monetization and demand-driven monetization to what you think of as the training expense. So I feel very good about the investment we are making and it's fungible and it just allows us to scale more long-term business."
493580,25,Amy Hood,"And maybe, Karl, just to reiterate a little of the comments that I made on CapEx because I think it's helpful to surround a bit more in what Satya is saying, a fungible fleet means. We have and I think we talked about it, close to $300 billion of RPO, that is committed customer contracts that need to be delivered on. And the faster we can do that and the more efficiently we can do that, the better off we are not just the OpenAI partnership, which is a piece of that, but with the entire platform that we need to deliver for our customers. And I think the other thing that's sometimes missing is when we say fungible, we mean not just the primary use, which we've always talked about, which is inference, but there is some training, post training, which is a key component. And then they're just running the commercial hub, which at every layer under at every modern AI app that's going to be built, it will be required. It will be required to be distributed, and it will be required to be global. And all of those things are really important because it then means you're the most efficient. And so the investment you see us making CapEx. You're right, the front end has been this sort of infrastructure build that lets us really catch up not just on the AI infrastructure we needed, but think about that as the building itself, data centers, but also some of the catch-up we need to do on the commercial cloud side. And then you'll see the pivot to more CPU and GPU. And that pivot will more directly correlate to revenue and it will be contracted either with the partnership that you asked about with OpenAI or with others. And so I do think the way I want everyone to internalize it is that the CapEx growth is going through that cycle pivot, which is far more correlated to customer contract delivery, no matter who the end customer is."
493580,26,Karl Keirstead,Thank you.
493580,27,Brett Iversen,"Thanks, Karl. Operator, next question please."
493580,28,Operator,And the next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
493580,29,Brad Zelnick,"Thank you very much for taking my question. And I'll echo my congrats and gratitude to Brett as well. Satya, as we think about Microsoft's very rich Copilot portfolio, now having been in market for over a year, with the products and precision only getting better and the cost of inference coming down, how do you think about the journey from here and perhaps the ability to package and evolve the go-to-market to address the broadest range of customers and customer requirements out there? Thanks."
493580,30,Satya Nadella,"Thanks, Brad, for the question. In fact you saw us make two announcements recently. One is on the M365 Copilot side, we now have the Copilot Chat. So this is now going to be broadly deployed across the entire install base effectively because you can go have this now turned on by IT and everybody can start using web-grounded chat with all the enterprise controls right away it has Copilot Studio built in. And so that means they can start building agents. So we think of that plus the full Copilot as a good combination that I think will accelerate quite frankly in terms of just seat usage and agent building and what have you. So that's sort of one. And the other thing is you also see even on the consumer side, we just yesterday launched o1, the Think Harder feature on Copilot now that's powered by o1, it's available globally, right. So you can see the benefits of inference optimization and the cost coming down means you can drive more ubiquity of what were features that ones were sort of premium tier and that's all definitely something that we will do across, right. The same thing is happening in GitHub Copilot, same thing in Security Copilot. So across the length and breadth of our portfolio, you'll see that."
493580,31,Brad Zelnick,Thank you.
493580,32,Brett Iversen,"Thanks, Brad. Operator, next question please."
493580,33,Operator,The next question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Please proceed.
493580,34,Brad Reback,"That's great. Thank you very much. Satya, if you look out several years, any sense of what percent of inference done on Azure will be done on proprietary models versus open models. And with that said, does it matter to Microsoft at the end of the day? Thanks."
493580,35,Satya Nadella,"Yes, it's a good question because at some level, what you're seeing is effectively lots of models that get used in any application, right. When you look underneath even a Copilot or a GitHub Copilot or what have you, you already see lots of many different models that you build models, you fine tune models, you distill models. Some of them are models that you distill into an open source model. So there's going to be a combination. So we've always maintained that it's always good to have frontier models. You want to always build your application with high ambition using the best model that is available and then optimize from there on. So that's also another side like there's a temporality to it, right. What you start with as a given COGS profile doesn't need to be the end because you continuously optimize for latency and COGS and putting in different mode. And in fact, all that complexity, by the way, has to be managed by a new app server. So one of the things that we are investing heavily on is foundry because from an app developer perspective, you kind of want to keep pace with the flurry of models that are coming in and you want to have an evergreen way for your application to benefit from all that innovation. But not have all the Dev cost or the DevOps cost or what people talk about AIOps costs. So we are also investing significantly in all the app server for any workload to be able to benefit from all these different models, open source, close source, different weight classes. And at the same time, from an operations perspective, it's faster, easier for you."
493580,36,Brad Reback,Great. Thank you.
493580,37,Brett Iversen,"Thanks, Brad. Operator, next question please."
493580,38,Operator,And the next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please proceed.
493580,39,Bradley Sills,"Wonderful. Thank you so much. Great to hear about the strength you're seeing in Copilot. Would love to get some color as to where you're seeing that strength? Is it departmental deals, customers moving from proof-of-concept to departmental deals, maybe multiple departmental deals in the enterprise. You mentioned some uptick in usage trends. Would love to get some color on just the common use cases that you're seeing that give you that confidence that, that will ramp into monetization later. Thank you."
493580,40,Satya Nadella,"Yes. I mean, I think the initial sort of set of seats were for places where there's more belief in immediate productivity, a sales team, in finance or in supply chain, where there is a lot of like, for example, SharePoint rounded data that you want to be able to use in conjunction with web data and have it produce results that are beneficial. But then what's happening, very much like what we have seen in the previous generation productivity things is that people collaborate across functions, across roads, right. For example, even in my own daily habit is, I go to chat, I use work tab, I get results, and then I immediately share using pages with colleagues. I sort of call it think with AI and work with people. And that pattern then requires you to make it more of a standard issue across the enterprise. And so that's what we are seeing. It starts maybe at a department level. Quickly, the collaboration network effects will effectively demand that you spread it across. You can do it by cohort and what have you. And so what we've made it easier even is to start with Copilot Chat plus this. And so that gives the enterprise customers even more flexibility to have something that's more ubiquitous."
493580,41,Bradley Sills,Wonderful. Thank you so much.
493580,42,Brett Iversen,"Thanks, Brad. Operator, we have time one last question."
493580,43,Operator,And the last question will come from the line of Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. Please proceed.
493580,44,Brent Bracelin,"Thank you for taking the question here. Good afternoon. I wanted to go back to commercial Bookings. Commercial RPO, I think, increased 39 billion sequentially. That's the most we've ever seen on a sequential basis, commercial bookings growth, 75% constant currency. That's 2x higher than we've seen in the last decade. I appreciate there's some volatility with this metric, but it does feel like this quarter there was a bit of a sea change relative to momentum on backlog and bookings. Can you just talk about maybe the breadth of where that strength came from? Was it broad-based? Was there a couple of large deals? Any color there would be helpful? Thanks."
493580,45,Amy Hood,"Thanks, Brent. It's a great question. We talked a little bit about what are the main drivers, which was one of the Azure commitments that OpenAI has made. And I do want to say, well, that is obviously a big component, you'll continue to see OpenAI make commitment. So I want to separate the concept that it's one time versus an ongoing relationship that will grow as they grow, which it absolutely will. And to your question on what else is participating in that number. First, we did have very good core motions. Our core motions are things like, to your point, renewals of our existing contracts, add-on to those contracts upsell like, for example, Copilot or GitHub Copilot or other processes. And I think that's important. We also had a good E5 quarter, which when we talk a lot about M365 Copilot, I sometimes forget to also talk about suite momentum. And we saw that as well this quarter, which we felt very good about. And then the final component is large Azure commitments. And those really did look as we expected, which is good. To your point, and that you're seeing a really broad-based growth. Those Azure commitments take two forms. One, it's existing customers who've worked through their commitments and are making larger commitments, which is a good commitment signed for the platform. And then you have new customers making commitments, and we also saw that this quarter. And so to your point, sometimes I think a big number that looks like this can make you think it's just one thing. I think you're right. Some of it was one thing, but a lot of it was good execution consistently across the workloads."
493580,46,Brent Bracelin,Helpful color. Thank you.
493580,47,Brett Iversen,"Thanks, Brad. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining today and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon."
493580,48,Satya Nadella,Thank you all.
493580,49,Amy Hood,Thank you.
493580,50,Operator,This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and enjoy the rest of your day.
356feaba86cbd4413ab502a9a29d7716,1,AI Insights,
356feaba86cbd4413ab502a9a29d7716,2,Operator,"Greetings, and welcome to the Microsoft Fiscal Year 2025 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Jonathan Neilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead."
356feaba86cbd4413ab502a9a29d7716,3,Jonathan Neilson,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today.

356feaba86cbd4413ab502a9a29d7716,4,Satya Nadella,"Thank you, Jonathan. It was a record quarter, driven by continued strength of Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $42 billion in revenue, up 22% in constant currency. Cloud and AI are the essential inputs for every business to expand output, reduce costs, and accelerate growth. Now, I will highlight examples, starting with infrastructure. We continue to expand our data center capacity. This quarter alone, we opened DCs in 10 countries across four continents. Model capabilities are doubling in performance every six months, thanks to multiple, compounding scaling laws. We continue to optimize and drive efficiencies across every layer – from DC design, to hardware and silicon, to systems software, to model optimization – all towards lowering costs and increasing performance. You see this in our supply chain, where we have reduced dock-to-lead times for new GPUs by nearly 20%. Across our blended fleet, where we have increased AI performance by nearly 30% ISO power. And, our cost per token, which has more than halved. When it comes to cloud migrations, we saw accelerating demand, with customers in every industry, from Abercrombie & Fitch Co., to Coca-Cola and ServiceNow, expanding their footprints on Azure. And we remain the cloud of choice for customers’ mission critical VMWare, SAP, and Oracle workloads, with more regional availability than any other hyperscaler. We are also excited about the next frontier in cloud systems with quantum. In addition to putting our quantum stack on machines from our partners, we are also making real progress on a path to a utility scale quantum computer with the introduction of Majorana-1. When it comes to data and analytics, we have deeply integrated our AI platform with our data stack. PostgreSQL usage accelerated for the third consecutive quarter, and it is now used by nearly 60% of the Fortune 500 including companies like BMW and BNY Mellon. Cosmos DB revenue growth also accelerated again this quarter and remains the go-to database for globally distributed NoSQL workloads at any scale. It is used by customers in every industry like CarMax, DocuSign, NTT Data, and OpenAI. This quarter, we also saw analytics consumption accelerate. Microsoft Fabric has more than 21,000 paid customers, up 80% year-over-year. Fabric brings together data workloads like data warehousing, data science, real-time intelligence, along with Power BI, into one end-to-end solution. Real-time intelligence is now the fastest growing workload in Fabric, with 40% of customers already using it just five months since becoming generally available. All up, more than 50% of Fabric customers – like Amore Pacific, Louisiana state government, and Petrobras – use three or more workloads. And the amount of data in our multi-cloud data lake OneLake has grown more than 6X over the past year. Now, on to AI platforms and tools. Foundry is the agent and AI app factory. It is now used by developers at over 70,000 enterprises and digital natives – from Atomicwork, to Epic, Fujitsu, and Gainsight, to H&R Block and LG Electronics – to design, customize, and manage their AI apps and agents. We processed over 100 trillion tokens this quarter, up 5X year-over-year – including a record 50 trillion tokens last month alone. And four months in, over 10,000 organizations have used our new Agent Service to build, deploy, and scale their agents. This quarter we also made a new suite of fine-tuning tools available to customers with industry-leading reliability. And we brought the latest models from OpenAI, along with new models from Cohere, DeepSeek, Meta, Mistral, Stability to Foundry. And we have expanded our Phi family of SLMs with new multimodal and mini models. All up, Phi has been downloaded 38 million times. And our research teams are taking it one step further, with BitNet b1.58, a billion parameter large language model that can run on just CPUs, coming to the Foundry. Now, on to developer tools. We are evolving GitHub Copilot from pair to peer programmer. With agent mode in VS Code, Copilot can now iterate on code, recognize errors, and fix them automatically. This adds to other Copilot agents like Autofix, which helps developers remediate vulnerabilities, as well as Code Review Agent, which has already reviewed over 8 million pull requests. And we are previewing a first-of-its-kind SWE agent capable of asynchronously executing developer tasks. All-up, we now have over 15 million GitHub Copilot users, up over 4X year-over-year. And both digital natives like Twilio and enterprises like Cisco, HPE, SkyScanner, and Target, continue to choose GitHub Copilot to equip their developers with AI throughout the entire dev lifecycle. With Visual Studio and VS Code, we have the world’s most popular editor, with over 50 million monthly active users. And with Power Platform we have the leading low code platform for AI makers too. We now have 56 million monthly active Power Platform users, up 27% year-over-year, who increasingly use our AI features to build apps and automate processes. Now, on to the future of work. Microsoft 365 Copilot is built to facilitate human-agent collaboration. Hundreds of thousands of customers across geographies and industries now use Copilot, up 3X year-over-year. Our overall deal size continues to grow, and this quarter, we saw a record number of customers returning to buy more seats. And we are going further. Just last week, we announced a major update, bringing together agents, notebooks, search, and create into a new scaffolding for work. Our new Researcher and Analyst deep reasoning agents analyze vast amounts of web and enterprise data to deliver highly-skilled expertise on demand directly within Copilot. Beyond horizontal knowledge work, we are introducing agents for every role and business process. Our Sales Agent turns contacts into qualified leads, and with Sales Chat reps can quickly get up to speed on new accounts. And our Customer Service Agent is deflecting customer inquiries and helping service reps resolve issues faster. With Copilot Studio, customers can extend Copilot and build their own agents with no-code/low code. More than 230,000 organizations – including 90% of the Fortune 500 – have already used Copilot Studio. With deep reasoning and agent flows in Copilot Studio, customers can build agents that perform more complex tasks, and also handle deterministic scenarios like document processing and financial approvals. And they can now build “computer use” agents that take action on the UI across desktop and web apps. And, with just a click, they can turn any SharePoint site into an agent too. This quarter alone, customers created over 1 million custom agents across SharePoint and Copilot Studio, up 130% quarter-over-quarter. When it comes to business applications, Dynamics 365 again took share as companies like Avaya, Brunswick, SoftCat, switched to Dynamics from legacy providers. Verizon, for example, chose Dynamics 365 Sales to improve the efficiency of its sellers. In healthcare, Dragon Copilot is off to a fast start. Last quarter alone, we helped document nearly 9.5 million physician-patient encounters at providers like City of Hope, Ottawa Hospital, Tufts Medicine and WellStar, up over 50% quarter-over-quarter. In manufacturing, we introduced Factory Operations and Safety Agents at Hannover Messe. And leading partners like Autodesk, PTC, and Siemens have all built their own industrial AI solutions on our stack. And, in retail, we have introduced agents to help customers like Bath & Body Works build more personalized shopping experiences and improve store operations. When it comes to Windows, Copilot+ PCs are faster and have better battery life than other devices in their category. We also continue to win new customers with best-in-class AI capabilities. We offer a growing number of AI apps from partners like Adobe, Canva, and Zoom. Just last week, we rolled out exclusive AI experiences like Recall, Click to Do, and Windows Search, to all Copilot+ PCs. And we continue to see increased commercial traction as we approach end-of-support for Windows 10. Windows 11 commercial deployments increased nearly 75% year-over-year. Now, on to security. Security is our top priority, and we have made significant progress against the engineering objectives we outlined a year and a half ago as part of our Secure Future Initiative. We are now applying these learnings to deliver new innovation across our platform. Last month, along with our partners, we introduced Security Copilot agents to help defenders autonomously handle high-volume security and IT tasks, informed by 84 trillion daily threat signals. We also added new capabilities to Defender, Entra, and Purview to help organizations secure and govern their AI deployments. All up, we now have 1.4 million security customers. Over 900,000 – including EY Global, Manpower Group, TriNet, Regions Bank – have 4 or more workloads, up 21% year-over-year. And, in identity, Entra now has more than 900 million monthly active users. Now, on to our consumer businesses, starting with LinkedIn. Over one billion professionals use LinkedIn to connect, learn, hire, and sell – and our membership continues to grow at double digits year-over-year. Time spent watching videos on the platform was up 36%, and comments were up 32% year-over-year. We are also seeing more members use AI to gain new skills and find jobs. The number of learners who have used AI-powered coaching increased over 2X quarter-over-quarter. And we remain the market leader in hiring, as customers like Equinix and Verizon use LinkedIn Hiring Assistant to find qualified candidates faster. When it comes to LinkedIn Premium, we saw over 75% quarter-over-quarter subscriber growth to our Premium Pages offering for SMBs. And LinkedIn Marketing Solutions continues to be the best way to reach B2B decision makers, with two consecutive quarters of accelerated revenue growth. More broadly, when it comes to advertising, we are transforming how people search, browse, discover content, and use AI as a personal assistant. With Copilot Search in Bing, we are reimagining search results with overview pages curated by AI, and embedded conversational capabilities. With Copilot Vision in Edge, Copilot sees what you see and gives you real-time responses while you browse. With Copilot Discover, we are personalizing the MSN experience, based on user interactions and preferences. And with our updated Copilot app, we are focused on building daily engagement and successful sessions across a range of modalities, whether it is conversing, searching, shopping, or travel planning. All up, we again took share across Bing and Edge. And our total advertising revenue across our businesses has surpassed $20 billion over the last 12 months. Now, on to gaming. We continue to transform the business and focus on margin expansion, as we bring our games to over 500 million monthly active users across devices. We ended the quarter as the top publisher by pre-orders and pre-installs on both Xbox and the PlayStation Store. PC Game Pass revenue increased over 45% year-over-year. With Xbox Play Anywhere, players now can access more than 1,000 games they can play across console and PC. And just last week we brought cloud gaming to LG TVs. Cloud gaming set a new record, surpassing 150 million hours played for the first time this quarter. We are also integrating AI across Xbox. New Copilot for Gaming is a personalized gaming companion that provides in-game assistance and expert coaching. And our first of its kind Muse model can generate gameplay in real-time. Finally, it is fantastic to see the success of Minecraft Movie which is the top grossing film of the year. In addition to monetizing our IP in new ways, we have seen a 75 percent-plus increase in weekly active users of the game year-over-year since the release. In closing, we are rapidly innovating to expand our opportunity across both consumer and commercial businesses. In just a few weeks, at our Build conference, we will share how we’re creating the most powerful AI platform for developers—and I encourage you to tune in. With that, let me turn it over to Amy."
356feaba86cbd4413ab502a9a29d7716,5,Amy Hood,"Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. This quarter, revenue was $70.1 billion, up 13% and 15% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 11% and 13% in constant currency while operating income increased 16% and 19% in constant currency. And earnings per share was $3.46, an increase of 18% and 19% in constant currency. Results exceeded expectations driven by focused execution from our sales and partner teams. We continue to see strong demand for our cloud and AI offerings as they help customers drive productivity, increase efficiencies, and grow their businesses. And, again this quarter, revenue from our AI business was above expectations. Commercial bookings increased 18% and 17% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations again this quarter, driven by an Azure commitment from OpenAI. We also saw consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions and continued long-term commitments to our platform. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased to $315 billion, up 34% and 33% in constant currency. Roughly 40% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 17% year over year. The remaining portion, recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 47%. And this quarter, our annuity mix was 98%. FX was roughly in line with expectations on total company revenue, segment level revenue, and operating expense growth. FX decreased COGS growth by only 1 point, 1 point unfavorable to expectations. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $42.4 billion, ahead of expectations, and grew 20% and 22% in constant currency. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage was 69%, in line with expectations, and decreased 3 points year over year driven by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. Company gross margin percentage was also 69%, down 1 point year over year driven by scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 2% and 3% in constant currency, lower than expected due to our focus on cost efficiencies as well as investments that shifted to Q4. Operating margins increased 1 point year over year to 46%, better than expected as we continue to focus on building high-performing teams and increasing our agility by reducing layers with fewer managers. At a total company level, headcount at the end of March was 2% higher than a year ago and was down slightly compared to last quarter. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $29.9 billion and grew 10% and 13% in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by LinkedIn, Microsoft 365 commercial products, and Microsoft 365 consumer. M365 commercial cloud revenue increased 12% and 15% in constant currency, in line with expectations. ARPU growth was again driven by E5 and M365 Copilot. With M365 Copilot, we continue to see growth across customer segments and geos. Paid M365 commercial seats grew 7% year over year to over 430 million. While we continue to see installed base expansion across all customer segments, growth was primarily driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. M365 commercial products revenue increased 5% and 8% in constant currency, ahead of expectations due to higher-than-expected Office transactional purchasing. M365 consumer cloud revenue increased 10% and 12% in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by higher-than-expected subscription growth following the January price increase. M365 consumer subscriptions grew 9% to 87.7 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 7% and 8% in constant currency. Results were ahead of expectations due to better-than-expected performance across all businesses. The Talent Solutions business continues to be impacted by weakness in the hiring market. Dynamics 365 revenue increased 16% and 18% in constant currency, in line with expectations with continued growth across all workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 10% and 13% in constant currency and gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged year over year even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 1% and 2% in constant currency and operating income increased 15% and 18% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $26.8 billion and grew 21% and 22% in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by Azure. In Azure and other cloud services, revenue grew 33% and 35% in constant currency including 16 points from AI services. Focused execution drove non-AI services results where we saw accelerated growth in our enterprise customer segment as well as some improvement in our scale motions. And, in Azure AI services, we brought capacity online faster than expected. In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 6% and 4% in constant currency, slightly below expectations driven by renewals with lower in-period revenue recognition from the mix of contracts. The year over year decline is reflective of the continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Enterprise and partner services revenue increased 5% and 6% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations due to better-than-expected performance in Enterprise Support Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and 14% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased 4 points year over year driven by scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 6% and 7% in constant currency and operating income grew 17% and 18% in constant currency. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $13.4 billion and grew 6% and 7% in constant currency, ahead of expectations due to better-than-expected results across all businesses. Windows OEM and Devices revenue increased 3% year over year, ahead of expectations as tariff uncertainty through the quarter resulted in inventory levels that remained elevated. Search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 21% and 23% in constant currency. Results were significantly ahead of expectations driven by usage from a third-party partnership, better-than-expected rate expansion, and volume growth across Edge and Bing. And in Gaming, revenue increased 5% and 6% in constant currency. Xbox content and services revenue increased 8% and 9% in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by stronger-than-expected performance in third-party and first-party content. Segment gross margin dollars increased 9% and 11% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased 2 points year over year driven by strong execution on margin improvement in Search and Gaming. Operating expenses increased 1%. Operating income increased 21% and 23% in constant currency driven by continued prioritization of higher margin opportunities. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were $21.4 billion, slightly lower than expected due to normal variability from the timing of delivery of data center leases. Cash paid for PP&E was $16.7 billion. Roughly half of our cloud and AI related spend was on long-lived assets that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond. The remaining cloud and AI spend was primarily for servers, both CPUs and GPUs, to serve customers based on demand signals including our customer contracted backlog of $315 billion. Cash flow from operations was $37 billion, up 16% driven by strong cloud billings and collections, partially offset by higher tax payments. And this quarter, free cash flow was $20.3 billion. Other income and expense was negative $623 million, more favorable than anticipated primarily due to net gains on derivatives and investments. Our losses on investments accounted for under the equity method were slightly higher than expected. Our effective tax rate was approximately 18%. And finally, we returned $9.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, an increase of 15% year over year. Now, moving to our Q4 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a US dollar basis. First, thru April, demand signals across our commercial businesses as well as in LinkedIn, Gaming, and Search have remained consistent. Our outlook assumes those trends continue in Q4. If the environment changes, our results may be impacted. In our Windows OEM business, our outlook assumes the elevated inventory levels from Q3 will come down in Q4. We have widened our guidance range in our More Personal Computing segment to account for some of this variability. Next, FX. With the weakening of the US dollar in April, we now expect FX to increase total revenue growth by one point. Within the segments, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by one point in Productivity and Business Processes and less than one point in Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing. We expect FX to increase COGS and operating expense growth by less than one point. In commercial bookings, we expect solid growth on a significant prior year comparable and a growing expiry base. Bookings growth will be driven by strong execution across our core annuity sales motions and continued long-term commitments to our platform. As a reminder, larger longer-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 67%, down year over year primarily driven by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. And now, capital expenditures. We expect Q4 capital expenditures to increase on a sequential basis. H2 capex in total remains unchanged from our January H2 guidance. As a reminder, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure buildouts and the timing of delivery of finance leases. Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes we expect revenue of $32.05 to $32.35 billion, or growth of 11% to 12% in constant currency. M365 commercial cloud revenue growth should be approximately 14% in constant currency, relatively stable compared to the prior quarter. We expect continued ARPU growth thru E5 and M365 Copilot and some seat growth moderation given the size of the installed base. M365 commercial products revenue growth should be in the mid-single digits. As a reminder, M365 commercial products includes both the Windows Commercial on-premises components of M365 suites and Office transactional purchasing, both of which can be variable due to in period revenue recognition dynamics. M365 consumer cloud revenue growth should be in the mid-teens driven by the January price increase. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the high single digits. And in Dynamics 365, we expect revenue growth to be in the mid to high teens with continued growth across all workloads. For Intelligent Cloud we expect revenue of $28.75 to $29.05 billion or growth of 20% to 22% in constant currency. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q4 revenue growth to be between 34% and 35% in constant currency driven by strong demand for our portfolio of services. In our non-AI services, we expect focused execution to continue driving healthy growth. In our AI services, while we continue to bring datacenter capacity online as planned, demand is growing a bit faster. Therefore, we now expect to have some AI capacity constraints beyond June. In our on-premises server business, we again expect revenue to decline in the mid-single digits with the ongoing customer shift to cloud offerings. And in Enterprise and partner services, we expect revenue growth to be in the mid to high single digits driven by Enterprise Support Services. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to be $12.35 to $12.85 billion. Windows OEM and Devices revenue should decline in the mid to high single digits. We expect Windows OEM revenue to decline in the low to mid-single digits assuming OEM inventory levels come down thru the quarter as noted earlier, although the range of potential outcomes is wider than normal. Devices revenue should decline in the high teens. Search and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be in the high teens, even on a strong prior year comparable. We expect to see continued growth in both volume and revenue per search with share gains across Edge and Bing. Overall Search and news advertising revenue growth should be in the mid-teens. And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth to be in the high single digits driven by first-party content. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS of $23.6 to $23.8 billion or growth of 19% to 20% in constant currency and operating expense of $18 to $18.1 billion or growth of approximately 5% in constant currency. Therefore, even with ongoing AI investments as we scale, we continue to expect full-year FY25 operating margins to be up slightly year over year. Other income and expense is expected to be roughly negative $1.2 billion primarily driven by investments accounted for under the equity method. As a reminder, we do not recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on equity method investments. And lastly, we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. Now I’d like to share some closing thoughts as we look to the next fiscal year. We remain committed to investing against the strong demand signals we see for our services. So, as a reminder, our earlier comments on FY26 capital expenditures remain unchanged. We expect capex to grow, it will grow at a lower rate than FY25 and will include a greater mix of short-lived assets which are more directly correlated to revenue than long-lived assets. These investments, along with focused execution that delivers near-term value to our customers, will ensure we continue to lead through the cloud and AI opportunity ahead. With that, let’s go to Q&A, Jonathan."
356feaba86cbd4413ab502a9a29d7716,6,Jonathan Neilson,"Thanks, Amy. We’ll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?"
356feaba86cbd4413ab502a9a29d7716,7,Operator,[Operator instructions]
356feaba86cbd4413ab502a9a29d7716,8,"Keith Weiss, Morgan Stanley","Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question, and congratulations on a fantastic quarter in what all of us are looking at as a difficult environment, a lot of uncertainty out there, so really impressive to put up the results that you guys did. One of the things that we heard a lot about this quarter in the media and press reports was changing data center commitments, maybe Microsoft walking away from some of those data center commitments. But it sounds like the AI demand is very strong. You’re talking about not being able to hit all that demand with supply. Can you talk to us about what’s going on with your datacenter strategy? Are there any shifts taking place? And maybe in particular, Satya, you could talk about some of the comments that you had made about the potential risk for oversupplies and GPUs out in the future. What exactly was that risk you were talking about? And are you incorporating that risk into your datacenter strategy?"
356feaba86cbd4413ab502a9a29d7716,9,Satya Nadella,"Yeah. First of all, thanks, Keith, for the questions. The reality is, we’ve always been making adjustments to build, lease, what pace we build, all through the last 10-15 years. It’s just that you all pay a lot more attention to what we do quarter over quarter nowadays. Having said that, the key thing for us is to have our builds and lease be positioned for what is the workload growth of the future. That’s what you have to go and seek to. There’s a demand part to it. There is the shape of the workload part to it, and there is a location part to it. You don’t want to be upside-down on having one big data center in one region, when you have a global demand footprint. You don’t want to be upside-down when the shape of demand changes, because, after all, with essentially pre-training plus test time compute, that’s a big change in terms of how you think about even what is training. Forget inferencing. Fundamentally, given all of that, and then every time there’s great Moore’s Law, but remember, this is a compounding S-curve, which is, there’s Moore’s Law, there’s system software, there’s model architecture changes, there’s the app server efficiency. Given all of that, we just want to make sure we’re building, accounting for the latest and greatest information we have on all of that. And that’s what you see reflected, and I feel very, very good about the pace. In fact, Amy just mentioned, we will be short power. And so, therefore, but it’s not power. It’s not a blanket statement. I need power in specific places so that we can either lease or build at the pace at which we want. And so, that’s the plan that we’re executing. Maybe, Amy, you can add to that."
356feaba86cbd4413ab502a9a29d7716,10,Amy Hood,"Yeah, maybe just to add a little bit to Satya’s comments, just a reminder, these are very long lead time decisions. From land to build to buildouts can be lead times of five to seven years, two to three years. We’re constantly in a balancing position as we watch demand curves and many of things Satya watched. And the second part is just to maybe remind you, when Satya talks about being short power, he’s really talking about data center space. And so, we’ve continued through the second half to put things in place. In fact, we talked a little bit about pulling even some of that space to be ready earlier and being able to deliver that earlier to customers this quarter, which is really good work by the teams, as we continue to get more and more efficient at that process. And I look forward to being able to continue to do that in the future. I did talk about in my comments, we had hoped to be in balance by the end of Q4. We did see some increased demand, as you saw through the quarter. We are going to be a little short, still, a little tight as we exit the year, but are encouraged by that."
356feaba86cbd4413ab502a9a29d7716,11,Keith Weiss,"Excellent. Thank you, guys."
356feaba86cbd4413ab502a9a29d7716,12,Jonathan Neilson,"Thanks, Keith. Operator, next question, please."
356feaba86cbd4413ab502a9a29d7716,13,Operator,[Operator instructions]
356feaba86cbd4413ab502a9a29d7716,14,"Brent Thill, Jefferies","Thanks. Satya, on your comment about accelerating demand for cloud migrations, I’m curious if you could dig in and extrapolate a little more what you’re seeing there. Thank you."
356feaba86cbd4413ab502a9a29d7716,15,Satya Nadella,"Thanks, Brent. Yeah, I sort of think about three big things that are happening in the cloud, all at parallel, and there is also a relationship between them. One is, I’ll just say, the classic migration of whether it’s SQL, Windows Server. And so, that’s, again, got good steady state progress, because the reality is, I think everyone’s now, perhaps there’s another kick in the datacenter migrations, just because of the efficiency the cloud provides. That’s one part. The second piece is good data growth. You saw Postgres on Azure. I mean, forgetting SQL Server, Postgres on Azure is growing. Cosmos is growing, the analytic stuff I talked about with Fabric. It’s even the others, whether it is Databricks or even Snowflake on Azure are growing. We feel very good about Fabric growth and our data growth. Then the cloud-native growth, this is, again, before we even get to AI, some of the core compute consumption of cloud-native players is also very healthy. It was healthy throughout the quarter. We projected to go moving forward as well. Then the thing to notice is the ratio, and I think we’ve mentioned this multiple times before. If you look underneath even ChatGPT, in fact, that team does a fantastic job of thinking about not only their growth in terms of AI accelerators they need. They use Cosmos DB. They use Postgres. They use core compute and storage. And so, there’s even a ratio between any AI workload in terms of AI accelerator to others. Those are the four pockets, I would say, or four different trend lines, which all have a relationship with each other. And if I step back, and Amy and I talk a lot about this, this time around, there’s nothing certain for sure in the future, except for one thing, which is our largest business is our infrastructure business. And the good news here is the next big platform shift builds on that. It’s not a complete rebuild, having gone through some of these platform shift, where you have to come out on the other side with a full rebuild. If there is good news here, it’s that we have a good business in Azure that continues to grow, and the new platform depends on that. We want to stay disciplined and execute super well on that."

356feaba86cbd4413ab502a9a29d7716,19,"Mark Moerdler, Bernstein","Thank you very much for taking my question, and I will reiterate what my peers have said. Congratulations on the great quarter. Satya and Amy, Microsoft is a very different business than it was during the last recession. Incredible job you’ve done. If we get into a recession, and I hope we don’t, how do you think about the stability, the sustainability, revenue volatility of Microsoft today, if we were to get into recession? Would the business react early to recession or late? Would a recession have a more shallow impact on revenue? Any thoughts would be appreciated."
356feaba86cbd4413ab502a9a29d7716,20,Satya Nadella,"Maybe I’ll start and then Amy should add, Mark. The way, at least, I think we will approach it is, quite frankly, be very focused on how we help our customers if there is any turbulence in the macro, because one of the things that we feel we can do, just because of the efficiencies of the cloud, and the footprint we have and the differentiated layers of the stack, from the SaaS application side to the infrastructure side, I think if you buy into the argument that software is the most malleable resource we have to fight any type of inflationary pressure or any type of growth pressure where you need to do more with less, I think we can be super helpful in that. And so, if anything, we would probably have more of that mindset is how do we make sure we are helping our customers? And then, of course, we’ll look to share gains."

356feaba86cbd4413ab502a9a29d7716,23,"Karl Keirstead, UBS","Okay, thanks. A number of metrics to applaud, but I think the one that stands out to me is the 16 point growth rate lift to Azure from AI. Satya and Amy, I just wanted to ask if you could unpack that a little bit. Of course, you mentioned that you got a bit of a kicker from capacity coming online. But I’m a little bit more interested in where the demand came in above expectations, like what workload type. It’s hard for us to see that on the outside. Was it a surge in ChatGPT inference that landed in Azure? Was it an uptick in enterprise AI adoption? And Amy, do you think that 16 points could be higher in June? Thank you."
356feaba86cbd4413ab502a9a29d7716,24,Amy Hood,"Thanks, Karl, for the question. Just to provide some clarity, because I think your question implies something that we didn’t mean to imply on the call. First, the real outperformance in Azure this quarter was in our non-AI business. Then to talk about the AI business, really what was better was precisely what we said. We talked about this. We knew Q3 that we had really matched supply and demand pretty carefully, and so didn’t expect to do much better than we had guided to on the AI side. We’ve been quite consistent on that. The only real up side we saw on the AI side of the business was that we were able to deliver supply early to a number of customers. And being able to do that throughout the quarter creates quite a good benefit to us. But the majority of our outperformance versus where we had expected to be was on the non-AI piece of the business."
356feaba86cbd4413ab502a9a29d7716,25,Jonathan Neilson,"Thanks, Karl. Operator, next question, please."

356feaba86cbd4413ab502a9a29d7716,27,"Kash Rangan, Goldman Sachs","Hi, thank you very much. One question for Amy. You’ve said in the past that you can attain better and better capital efficiency with the Cloud business, and probably Cloud and AI business. Where do you stand today, Amy? Maybe, Satya, you can opine as well, that you’ve said before that you can slow down your CapEx growth rate, while still accelerate Azure, which includes AI. Can we get a market to market on that? Thank you."
356feaba86cbd4413ab502a9a29d7716,28,Amy Hood,"Maybe I’ll start, Kash, and let Satya add on, because I really think when you go back and read some of Satya’s comments on how the S-curves build on themselves, that’s actually the levers that go in to the answer of the question that you’re asking. And so, the way, of course, you’ve seen that historically is right when we went through the prior cloud transitions, you see CapEx accelerate. You build out datacenter footprints. You slowly fill CPU capacity. And over time, you see software efficiencies and hardware efficiencies build on themselves. And you saw that process for us, for, goodness, now, quite a long time. And what Satya’s talking about is how quickly that’s happening on the AI side of the business, and you add to that model diversity. Think about the same levers, plus model efficiency, those compound. Now, the one thing that’s a little different this time is just the pace. And so, when you’re seeing that happen, pace in terms of efficiency time, but also pace in terms of the buildout, so it can mask some of the progress. But we are working hard across all of the teams, hardware, software, even the build teams, to get things in place as quickly as possible, dock to live times. All of that is improving, and all of that actually is benefiting us. And I’ll go ahead and say our margins on the AI side of the business are better than they were at this point, by far than when we went through the same transition in the server to cloud transition."
356feaba86cbd4413ab502a9a29d7716,29,Satya Nadella,"Yeah, I mean, I think at a macro level, I think the way to think about this is, you can ask the question, what’s the difference between a hosting business and a hyperscale business? It’s software. That’s, I think, the gist of it. Yes, for sure, it’s a capital intensive business, but capital efficiency comes from that system wide software optimization. And that’s what makes the hyperscale business attractive, and that’s what we want to just keep executing super well on."
356feaba86cbd4413ab502a9a29d7716,30,Kash Rangan,"Super, Thanks so much."

356feaba86cbd4413ab502a9a29d7716,33,"Mark Murphy, JPMorgan","Thank you so much. Satya, you had commented recently that the DeepSeek moment is a real thing, and you had said that software efficiencies mean that the fleet will be aged for a longer time. Can you comment on how those advances are affecting the pace and volume of AI experimentation and activity in the marketplace? And Amy, could we start to consider the possibility that software enhancements might extend the useful life assumption that you’re using for GPUs, or is it a little premature to be thinking that way?"
356feaba86cbd4413ab502a9a29d7716,34,Satya Nadella,"Yeah. First of all, I think some of the work that actually, OpenAI first pioneered and did with all of the reasoning models, and of course, DeepSeek has added to it and done good work as well, and others as well, the idea that you can have test time compute plus pre-training, and then some of the great optimization at inference time that has all happened has proven out. I mean, if you look at it, I would say for every Moore’s Law change and movement, there’s probably a 10x improvement because of software. That’s what’s happening with these models. Some of it comes from model architecture. Some of that comes from data efficiency, compute efficiency, and what have you. That’s what we are riding, and we feel that, all up, when you have a commodity that is getting that better, then the question is, how do you build out a fleet that’s super balanced, so that then the workloads can be built and can, in fact, take advantage of that efficiency at the underlying infrastructure? I mean, it’s kind of like virtualization. What is the difference between servers and, again, client server with virtualization? It was efficiency. What is the difference between virtualization and cloud? It was efficiency. What is the difference between this generation of cloud and AI? It’s efficiency. The more you can kind of continue to think about software driving that efficiency is what drives demand, ultimately."
356feaba86cbd4413ab502a9a29d7716,35,Amy Hood,"And to your specific question, in terms of thinking about the depreciable life of an asset, we like to have a long history before we make any of those changes. We’re focused on getting every bit of useful life we can, of course, out of assets. But, to Satya’s point, that tends to be a software question more than a hardware one."

356feaba86cbd4413ab502a9a29d7716,39,"Kirk Materne, Evercore ISI","Yes, thanks very much, and congrats on a great quarter. Amy, you mentioned that the upside in Azure came from the non-AI services this time around. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about that. And I guess as you look forward, maybe what’s different this go round versus what we saw a few years ago, when, obviously, things like optimization weighed on the growth a little bit? It sounds like the product portfolio is much broader right now, but just wondering if you could add some color on that front. Thank you."
356feaba86cbd4413ab502a9a29d7716,40,Amy Hood,"Sure, and thanks for the question, Kirk. We know the non-AI. I talked a little bit about this. In general, we saw better than expected performance across our segments, but we saw acceleration in our largest customers. We call that the enterprise segment in general. And then in what we talked about of our scale notions, where we had some challenges in Q2, things were a little better. And we still have some work to do in our scale notions. And we’re encouraged by our progress. We’re excited to stay focused on that as, of course, we work through the final quarter of our fiscal year. By geo, the performance was pretty consistent. Satya actually highlighted some of the workloads that came in a little better than we thought. Obviously, just some good, consistent work on migration, good execution by the sales and partner teams, the data workloads he went through. And so, in general, Kirk, I wouldn’t say it’s anything beyond that. I do think it was improved execution. And I was happy to see it, but there’s still some work to do on our scale motions in particular."

356feaba86cbd4413ab502a9a29d7716,44,"Alex Zukin, Wolfe Research","Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in, and again, just amazing. Congratulations on those Azure numbers, which I think are, quite honestly, just inspiring. Maybe, Amy, to the point that you’re making that the surprise factor was on the non-AI side of the house, and it sounds like there’s confidence in that continuing beyond. How much of that are you starting to see the pull in of the non-AI driven by the AI portion of Azure? And on the AI portion, specifically, as test time compute really just blows out kind of prior conceptions of scaling law challenges, how much does that change, potentially, the curve of the AI Azure growth as you go forward here over the next few quarters?"
356feaba86cbd4413ab502a9a29d7716,45,Amy Hood,"Thanks, Alex. Let me, first of all, say I think we’ve talked about this quite a bit. It’s always a good chance to get to iterate this. It’s getting harder and harder to separate what an AI workload is from a non-AI workload. And we’ve talked about it this way, I think, in most instances, to make sure people understood that when we were accelerating all of our CapEx spend over the past two and a half or three years now, that people had confidence that we were turning that into revenue and product in a way that was transparent and that everyone could understand, really the goals that we had set for ourselves and for our partners and customers in terms of building product that turned to revenue. But if you take a step back from that, it’s that these workloads are being built, GPUs, CPUs, storage, network, all the same things. And so, I think really what we’re talking about is really how Satya talked about, in one of the earlier questions, we’re seeing digital natives. Digital natives build workloads. They do AI work. They do non-AI work. Do they tend to do that work in the same cloud? Lots of times. Sometimes it’s all in the same place, not all the time. But that relationship gets stronger and stronger as people pivot to more of AI heavy workloads. And so, I think you’re starting to see some of that relationship. I think we’ll continue to see that as AI workloads continue to get built and experimented with, and proof of concepts get expanded. And so, I think I mostly focus on the fact that together, we saw good performance in Q3 on Azure, Azure inclusive of both components, in terms of our execution, in terms of the field and partner teams, and backlog and conversion, and interesting workloads, and adding customer value, and solving real problems, and adding real value. And I think that’s probably, Alex, how I would approach that number, more than trying to separate it in the way that even we have talked about it, but for very different reasons."

253947fa58da1b3fca991a204618c86f,3,Satya Nadella,"Thank you, Jonathan. It was a very strong close to what was a record fiscal year for us. All up, Microsoft Cloud surpassed $168 billion in annual revenue, up 23%. The rate of innovation and the speed of diffusion is unlike anything we have seen. To that end, we are building the most comprehensive suite of AI products and tech stack at massive scale. And to provide more context, I want to walk up the stack, starting with Azure. Azure surpassed $75 billion in annual revenue, up 34%, driven by growth across all workloads. We continue to lead the AI infrastructure wave and took share every quarter this year. We opened new DCs across 6 continents and now have over 400 data centers across 70 regions, more than any other cloud provider. There is a lot of talk in the industry about building the first gigawatt and multi-gigawatt data centers. We stood up more than 2 gigawatts of new capacity over the past 12 months alone. And we continue to scale our own data center capacity faster than any other competitor. Every Azure region is now AI-first. All of our regions can now support liquid cooling, increasing the fungibility and the flexibility of our fleet. And we are driving and riding a set of compounding S curves across silicon, systems and models to continuously improve efficiency and performance for our customers. Take, for example, GPT4o family of models, which have the highest volume of inference tokens. Through software optimizations alone, we are delivering 90% more tokens for the same GPU compared to a year ago. Beyond the AI fleet, we continue to build our commercial cloud to address customers' unique data residency and sovereignty requirements. This quarter, we introduced the Microsoft Sovereign Cloud, the industry's most comprehensive solution spanning both public and private cloud deployments. All of this innovation is driving our strong results. We saw accelerating growth from migrations again this quarter. Nestle, for example, migrated more than 200 SAP instances, 10,000-plus servers, 1.2 petabytes of data to Azure with near 0 business disruption. That makes it one of the largest and most successful migrations in business history. The next big accelerator in the cloud will be Quantum, and I'm excited about our progress. In fact, earlier this month, we announced the world's first operational deployment of a Level 2 Quantum computer in partnership with Atom Computing. This is how we will continue to think and make investments, with decade-long arcs, while making progress every quarter. The next layer is data, which is foundational to every AI application. Microsoft Fabric is becoming the complete data and analytics platform for the AI era, spanning everything from SQL to no-SQL, to analytics workloads. It continues to gain momentum with revenue up 55% year-over-year and over 25,000 customers. It's the fastest-growing database product in our history. Fabric OneLake spans all databases and clouds, including semantic models from Power BI, and therefore, it is the best source of knowledge and grounding for AI applications and context engineering. Azure Databricks and Snowflake on Azure both accelerated as well. Cosmos DB and Azure PostgreSQL are both powering mission- critical workloads at scale. OpenAI, for example, uses Cosmos DB in the hot path of every ChatGPT interaction, storing chat history, user profiles and conversational state. And Azure PostgreSQL stores metadata critical to the operation of ChatGPT as well as OpenAI's developer APIs. This year, we launched Azure AI Foundry to help customers design, customize and manage AI applications and agents at scale. Foundry features best-in-class tooling, management, observability and built-in controls for trustworthy AI. Customers increasingly want to use multiple AI models to meet their specific performance, cost and use case requirements. And with Foundry, they can provision inferencing throughput once and apply it across more models than any other hyperscaler, including models from OpenAI, DeepSeek, Meta, xAI's Grok and, very soon, Black Forest Labs and Mistral AI. We sim-shipped 15 models from OpenAI alone on Foundry this year, providing same-day access to state-of-the-art models deeply integrated with our infrastructure and tools. And we are seeing accelerated adoption of our new Foundry Agent Service, which is now being used by 14,000 customers to build agents that automate complex tasks. For example, Nasdaq is using foundry to build agents that help customers prepare for Board meetings, cutting prep time by up to 25%. All up, 80% of Fortune 500 already use Foundry. And when we look narrowly at just the number of tokens served by Foundry APIs, we processed over 500 trillion this year, up over 7x. This is a good indicator of true platform diffusion beyond a few head apps and services. Talking about the app layer, these applications are becoming embedded in our daily work and life. Our family of Copilot apps has surpassed 100 million monthly active users across commercial and consumer. And when you take a broader look at the engagement of AI features across our products, we have over 800 million monthly active users. Microsoft 365 Copilot is becoming the new way to organize work and workflow and work artifacts. We rolled out our biggest update to Microsoft 365 Copilot to date this quarter, bringing together chat, search, create, notebooks as well as agents into one intuitive scaffolding. With this innovation and continued product improvements, we are seeing real momentum. Customers continue to adopt Copilot at a faster rate than any other new Microsoft 365 suite, with strong usage intensity as shown by our week-over-week retention. And we saw the largest quarter of seat adds since launch with a record number of customers returning to buy more seats. Barclays, for example, will roll out Microsoft 365 Copilot to 100,000 employees globally following a successful initial deployment of 15,000. UBS is expanding its deployment to all of its employees after initially rolling it out to 55,000 of them. And Adobe, KPMG, Pfizer, Wells Fargo all purchased over 25,000 seats this quarter. Tens of thousands of organizations have already used our Researcher and Analyst deep reasoning agents in the first weeks of availability. And we have introduced group-level agents in Teams like Facilitator and Interpreter, which generate real-time translation and notes in meetings. Hundreds of partners like Adobe, SAP, ServiceNow and Workday have built their own third-party agents that integrate with Copilot and Teams. We are also seeing more customers use Copilot Studio to extend Microsoft 365 Copilot and build their own agents. This year, customers created 3 million agents using SharePoint and Copilot Studio. And with Copilot Tuning, they can easily create agents fine- tuned on their company's data, workflow and style that reflect their unique tone, language and expertise. We're also seeing great traction among specific roles and functions, starting with developers. GitHub Copilot continues to have great momentum in IDE with Agent Mode and new form factors like Coding Agent which is capable of asynchronously executing developer tasks. We have 20 million GitHub Copilot users. GitHub Copilot enterprise customers increased 75% quarter-over-quarter as companies tailor Copilot to their own codebases, and 90% of the Fortune 100 now use GitHub Copilot. More broadly, GitHub usage and repos are seeing explosive growth because of AI. AI projects on GitHub more than doubled over the last year. The surge in vibe coding projects and AI coding agents, whether it is Claude Code, Codex, Cursor or GitHub Copilot, are generating more pull requests and more repos on GitHub. And our Code Review Agent is being used heavily across the platform, performing millions of code reviews each month. In health care, we had a breakout year for Dragon Copilot. Customers used our ambient AI solutions to document over 13 million physician-patient encounters this quarter, up nearly 7x year-over-year. For example, at Mercyhealth system, more than 1,000 physicians are already using Copilot to reduce administrative burden, so that they can focus on providing better care. They have saved more than 100,000 hours to date and plan to expand to all 5,000 providers. As one physician put it, ""The best thing to happen to my practice in 10 years."" And in security, we were the first in the industry to introduce agents to help defenders autonomously handle high-volume security and IT tasks. More broadly, AI is driving a fundamental change in the biz apps market as customers shift from legacy systems to agentic business applications. Dynamics 365 took share this year. And we are winning customers in every industry, like Verizon with Sales, Domino's Pizza Group with ERP, 1-800-Flowers with Contact Center. When it comes to consumer apps, we are innovating across all surfaces. In fact, on Monday, we introduced Copilot Mode in Edge. It's especially exciting to see the innovation coming back to browsers. Copilot Mode brings together Copilot composer, chat, discover, search and actions to build the next generation of browser for the AI age. Our Copilot consumer app also continued to see strong growth in engagement and successful sessions. And we are bringing Copilot to every Windows 11 PC. With Copilot Vision, you can share your screen with Copilot and get real-time insights and assistance on anything. And we are well positioned as we approach Windows 10 end of support in October, thanks to Windows 11 and Copilot+ PCs, which offer customers compelling security as well as AI value. Talking about security, it underlies our cloud and AI infrastructure as well as our Copilots and agents. We have launched over 100 new capabilities over the past year. Just last week, we added a modern data lake to our SIEM Microsoft Sentinel, bringing together customer data across our first-party tools as well as third-party ecosystem over 350 connectors. We are also extending the systems customers already use for governance, identity, security and management to protect every AI agent. Entra now extends identity permissions, policies and access controls to agents. Defender secures nearly 2 million general AI apps. Purview is used by 3/4 of the Microsoft 365 Copilot customers to protect their data. And all up, we now have nearly 1.5 million security customers and continue to take share across all major categories we serve. Before I wrap, I want to talk about 2 consumer businesses of ours with massive end-user reach: LinkedIn and Xbox. LinkedIn is home to 1.2 billion members with 4 consecutive years of double-digit member growth. All up, comments on LinkedIn rose over 30% and video uploads increased over 20% this year. We continue to bring AI to every part of LinkedIn experience, introducing agents across hiring as well as sales. When it comes to Gaming, we have 500 million monthly active users across platforms and devices. We are now the top publisher on both Xbox and PlayStation this quarter with successful launches of Forza Horizon 5 and Oblivion Remastered. The Call of Duty franchise has never been stronger. 50 million people have played Black Ops 6; total hours surpassed $2 billion. Minecraft saw record monthly active usage in revenue this quarter, thanks in large part to the success of the Minecraft Movie. And we have nearly 40 games in development, so much, much more to come. We surpassed over 500 million hours of gameplay stream via the cloud this year. And Game Pass annual revenue was nearly $5 billion for the first time. In closing, we are going through a generational tech shift with AI, and I have never been more confident in Microsoft's opportunity to drive long-term growth and define what the future looks like. With that, let me turn it over to Amy to walk through our financial results as well as the outlook."
253947fa58da1b3fca991a204618c86f,4,Amy E. Hood,"Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This year, we delivered over $281 billion in revenue, up 15% year-over-year, which reflects the broad strength of our products and services. Operating income was over $128 billion, up 17% year-over-year as we invested against the expansive opportunity ahead. And in our largest quarter of the year, we significantly exceeded expectations with strong execution by our sales and partner teams. As Satya shared, we're innovating faster than ever to deliver new value to our customers. This quarter, revenue was $76.4 billion, up 18%, and 17% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 16%, and 15% in constant currency, while operating income increased 23%, and 22% in constant currency. And earnings per share was $3.65, an increase of 24%, and 22% in constant currency. For the first time, commercial bookings were over $100 billion, increasing 37%, and 30% in constant currency, on a strong prior year comparable. Strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, including healthy renewals, as well as an increase in the number of $10 million and $100 million-plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365 helped drive these results. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased to $368 billion, up 37% and 35% in constant currency. Roughly 35% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 21% year-over-year. The remaining portion, recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 49%. And this quarter, our annuity mix was again 98%. FX was roughly in line with expectations on total company revenue, segment level revenue, COGS and operating expense growth. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $46.7 billion, ahead of expectations, and grew 27%, and 25% in constant currency. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage was slightly better than expected at 68%, down 2 points year-over-year from the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure, partially offset by continued efficiency gains in Azure and M365 Commercial Cloud. Company gross margin percentage was 69%, down 1 point year-over-year, driven by sales mix shift to Azure and the lower Microsoft Cloud gross margin noted earlier. Operating expenses increased 6% and 5% in constant currency, and operating margins increased 2 points year-over-year to 45%. Better-than-expected revenue growth coupled with a focus on operating efficiently drove the margin expansion. At a total company level, head count at the end of June was relatively unchanged year-over-year. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $33.1 billion and grew 16%, and 14% in constant currency, better than expected, driven by M365 Commercial products in cloud services and M365 Consumer products in cloud services. M365 Commercial Cloud revenue was ahead of expectations and increased 18%, and 16% in constant currency, with 2 points of benefit from in-period revenue recognition. Business trends remained relatively stable to the prior quarter when excluding the in-period revenue recognition, with ARPU growth again driven by E5 and M365 Copilot. Paid M365 commercial seats grew 6% year-over-year with installed base expansion across all customer segments, though primarily in our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. M365 Commercial Products revenue increased 9% and 7% in constant currency, ahead of expectations due higher-than-expected Office 2024 transactional purchasing. M365 Consumer cloud revenue was better than expected, increasing 20% driven by ARPU growth following the January price increase and subscriber growth of 8%. LinkedIn revenue increased 9%, and 8% in constant currency, with growth across all businesses, though Talent Solutions continues to be impacted by weakness in the hiring market. Dynamics 365 revenue increased 23%, and 21% in constant currency, with strong execution in our core annuity sales motions leading to growth across all workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 16% and 15% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased slightly, driven by the efficiency gains noted earlier, even as we deliver more AI features across our products and scale our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 7%, and 6% in constant currency. And operating income increased 21%, and 19% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $29.9 billion and grew 26%, and 25% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by Azure and our on-premises server business. In Azure and other cloud services, revenue grew 39%, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by accelerated growth in our core infrastructure business, primarily from our largest customers. As a reminder, new cloud and AI workloads are built and scaled using the breadth of our services. Revenue from Azure AI services was generally in line with expectations. And while we brought additional data center capacity online this quarter, demand remains higher than supply. In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 2%, and 3% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, primarily driven by transactional purchasing which also has higher in-period revenue recognition. Enterprise and Partner Services revenue increased 7%, and 6% in constant currency, with growth in Enterprise Support Services partially offset by a decline in Industry Solutions. Segment gross margin dollars increased 17%, and 16% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased 4 points year- over-year driven by scaling our AI infrastructure, partially offset by Azure efficiency gains noted earlier. Operating expenses increased 6%, and 4% in constant currency. And operating income grew 23%. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $13.5 billion and grew 9%, exceeding expectations, primarily due to Windows OEM as well as Xbox content and services. Windows OEM and Devices revenue increased 3% year-over-year, ahead of expectations, as inventory levels remained elevated. Search and news advertising revenue ex TAC increased 21% and 20% in constant currency, driven by continued growth in both volume and revenue per search, as well as roughly 8 points of favorable impact from third-party partnerships, including the benefit of a low prior-year comparable. And in Gaming, revenue increased 10%. Xbox content and services revenue increased 13%, and 12% in constant currency, driven by better-than-expected performance from first-party content and Xbox Game Pass. Segment gross margin dollars increased 15%. Gross margin percentage increased 3 points year-over-year with improvement across all businesses. Operating expenses increased 4%, and 3% in constant currency. Operating income increased 34%, and 33% in constant currency, driven by continued prioritization of higher margin opportunities. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures were $24.2 billion, including $6.5 billion of finance leases where we recognize the full value at the time of lease commencement. Cash paid for PP&E was $17.1 billion. The difference is primarily due to finance leases. More than half our spend was on long-lived assets that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond. The remaining spend was primarily for servers, both CPUs and GPUs, and driven by strong demand signals. Cash flow from operations was $42.6 billion, up 15%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections, partially offset by higher supplier payments. And this quarter, free cash flow was $25.6 billion. Other income and expense was negative $1.7 billion, primarily due to losses on investments accounted for under the equity method. Our effective tax rate was approximately 17%. And finally, we returned $9.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, bringing our total cash return to shareholders to over $37 billion for the full fiscal year. Now moving to our outlook. My commentary for both the full year and next quarter is on a U.S. dollar basis, unless specifically noted otherwise. Let me start with some full year commentary for FY '26. First, FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to increase full year revenue growth and COGS growth by approximately 2 points and to increase operating expense growth by 1 point. Next, building on the strong momentum we saw this past year, we expect to deliver another year of double-digit revenue and operating income growth in FY '26. We will continue to invest against the expansive opportunity ahead across both capital expenditures and operating expenses given our leadership position in commercial cloud, strong demand signals for our cloud and AI offerings, and significant contracted backlog. Capital expenditure growth, as we shared last quarter, will moderate compared to FY '25 with a greater mix of short-lived assets. Due to the timing of delivery of additional capacity in H1, including large finance lease sites, we expect growth rates in H1 will be higher than in H2. We remain focused on delivering revenue growth and increasing our operational agility. And as a result, we expect operating margins to be relatively unchanged year-over-year. And finally, we expect our FY '26 effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. Now to our outlook for the first quarter. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total revenue growth by 2 points. Within the segments, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by roughly 3 points in Productivity and Business Processes and roughly 1 point in Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing. We expect FX to increase COGS and operating expense growth by roughly 1 point. In Commercial bookings, we expect healthy growth on a growing expiry base. Bookings growth will again be driven by strong execution across our core annuity sales motions and long-term commitments to our platform. As a reminder, larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable on their timing, drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 67%, down year-over-year, driven by the impact of continuing to scale our AI infrastructure. We expect Q1 capital expenditures to be over $30 billion, driven by the continued strong demand signals we see. As a reminder, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure build-outs and the timing of delivery of finance leases. Next, to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of USD 32.2 billion to USD 32.5 billion, or growth of 14% to 15%, with roughly 3 points of benefit from FX as noted earlier. In M365 Commercial Cloud, we expect revenue growth to be between 13% and 14% in constant currency, with business trends that remain relatively stable compared to the prior quarter. ARPU growth will again be driven by E5 and M365 Copilot. M365 Commercial Products revenue growth should be in the mid- to high single digits. As a reminder, M365 Commercial Products includes both the Windows Commercial on-premises components of M365 suites and Office transactional purchasing, both of which can be variable due to in-period revenue recognition dynamics. M365 Consumer Cloud revenue growth should be in the low 20s, driven by the January price increase. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the high single digits. And in Dynamics 365, we expect revenue growth to be in the high teens with continued growth across all workloads. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue of USD 30.1 billion to USD 30.4 billion, or growth of 25% to 26%, with roughly 1 point of benefit from FX as noted earlier. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which can have quarterly variability in year-on-year growth rates depending on the timing of capacity delivery and when it comes online, as well as from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q1 revenue growth of approximately 37% in constant currency, driven by strong demand for our portfolio of services on a significant base. Even as we continue bringing more data center capacity online, we currently expect to remain capacity- constrained through the first half of our fiscal year. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid-single digits with the ongoing customer shift to cloud offerings. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to be USD 12.4 billion to USD 12.9 billion. Windows OEM and Devices revenue should decline in the mid- to high single digits. We expect the elevated inventory levels at the end of Q4 to come down through the quarter in Windows OEM, although the range of potential outcomes remains wider than normal. Devices revenue should decline. Search and news advertising ex TAC revenue growth should be in the low to mid-teens, down sequentially as growth rates normalize following the benefit from third-party partnerships noted earlier. Growth will continue to be driven by volume and revenue per search across Edge and Bing. Overall search and news advertising revenue growth should be in the low double digits. And in Gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the mid to high single digits. Against a strong prior year comparable, we expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline in the mid-single digits. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS of USD 24.3 billion to USD 24.5 billion, or growth of 21% to 22%, and operating expense of USD 15.7 billion to USD 15.8 billion, or growth of 5% to 6%. Other income and expense is estimated to be negative $1.3 billion, primarily due to investments accounted for under the equity method. As a reminder, we do not recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on equity method investments. And lastly, we expect our Q1 effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. In closing, we finished the year with double-digit revenue and operating income growth and exceeded the FY '25 operating margin commitment we shared a year ago. Our focus remains on investing in security, quality and AI platform and product innovation that delivers value and opportunity to our customers. We are excited for FY '26. With that, let's go to Q&A, Jonathan."
253947fa58da1b3fca991a204618c86f,5,Jonathan Neilson,"Thanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?"
253947fa58da1b3fca991a204618c86f,6,Operator,[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.
253947fa58da1b3fca991a204618c86f,7,Keith Weiss,"Congratulations on a fantastic end to FY '25. I've been covering Microsoft for a while, I don't think I've ever seen a quarter where like everything came together this well. So congratulations on that execution. Maybe a little bit longer-term focused question to start out. You guys have always had software start-ups as customers and potentially emerging competitors. But the AI labs now feel different. Investors are ascribing valuations which assume these companies become major players in software. They're underwriting revenue forecasts measured in the tens of billions, if not hundreds of billions. And these start-ups have also grown to be some of your biggest customers, so they're contributing significantly to Microsoft today. So it seems like there's a lot of potential opportunity in supporting those businesses, but also it's not certain that they're going to stay your customers as they scale. They could in-source some of that infrastructure. And they very likely emerge as potential competitors. So as managers of Microsoft, as managers of the capital, how do you guys manage that risk versus reward with these quickly emerging AI labs and these AI start-ups?"
253947fa58da1b3fca991a204618c86f,8,Satya Nadella,"Thanks, Keith, for the question. I don't think it's that different from even sort of the previous era. There's always been, I'll call it, head apps or head -- new companies that emerge, that in fact are very needed in order to birth a new platform. Back in the day when I was getting started on Azure, I used to look over the lake and sort of see Netflix and Amazon, and I say, ""I wish Netflix ran on Azure."" And in some sense, that's kind of what we now have, which is the largest AI workloads run on Azure. And when that happens, you learn the workload faster, you optimize the entire platform faster, everything from what you're doing -- what we're doing with Cosmos DB for a chat interface like ChatGPT or Copilot, is, guess what, going to be the most relevant for any AI application going forward. The entire data stack that we have now built is going to be optimized for what people describe as one of the hardest challenges of any AI application, called context engineering, right, which is how do you collect your data and then make sure that the context around the problems remain stable over a long period so that you get the intelligence to actually deliver the results you want. So these are workload results that are invaluable for us to learn to build both the products as well as the platform. And then broadly, they -- or rather over time, there will be broad diffusion. In fact, one of the things that Amy and I track is not just the head app usage, but also what's the sort of all the Tier 2 applications that are being built. So that sort of -- that speaks a little bit, Keith, to I think your question, is as long as we have head apps shaping the platform and then, after that, we have the broad diffusion happen, which in some sense both of those is what we are seeing. So I feel very good about our being in decent standing going forward."
253947fa58da1b3fca991a204618c86f,9,Operator,The next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research.
253947fa58da1b3fca991a204618c86f,10,Mark L. Moerdler,"I'd also give you my congratulations. Amazing. I didn't know how you were going to beat last quarter, and you did it. So congratulations. Satya and Amy, we're now 2-plus years into the GenAI revolution and adoption is still early and ramping. What do you think is the best way that software companies are going to be able to monetize AI for SaaS? Do you believe there are differences in monetization for horizontal, more general apps like M365 Copilot or Dynamics CRM Copilot versus very targeted capacities on the agentic side? And also, how should you think about the trajectory of SaaS AI margins over the long term?"
253947fa58da1b3fca991a204618c86f,11,Satya Nadella,"Yes. I'll start, and Amy, you should feel free to add. I mean if I just broaden out beyond just SaaS as a category, I think just like the server-to-cloud transition was an expansion of essentially usage of servers. That is essentially what happened with the cloud, right, which is we did a bunch of servers except that the expertise required, the capital required, the time required to bring up servers, build it out, scale it, was just all hard. And so therefore, the market was a certain size. Whereas with the cloud, you could sort of buy it with flexibility, you could burst and you could spin up and spin down, the expertise required came down, so it was just -- orders of magnitude. That's what's happening. So if you sort of even subscribe to this point of view that intelligence is basically log of compute, that means compute is going to grow and you've got to use it as efficiently as possible to just keep creating intelligence. Now how does it manifest beyond just the infrastructure? I kind of, to Keith's earlier question, I talked a little bit about how the infrastructure is getting shaped, data layer is getting shaped, the app server is getting built. These are all classic categories of infrastructure that will continue, but there will be an order or 2 of magnitude more. So literally, like -- in fact, one of the other things we track is every GPU requires storage and compute. That ratio is another thing that is really exponential for infrastructure growth. So when you go to the app layer, the SaaS apps themselves are now building in effectively agentic and chat interfaces with intelligence. And they're also building autonomous agents. Agents are kind of like applications, like a database application perhaps, but they are being used increasingly inside of a user interaction. I think a good example is GitHub Copilot. It got started as code completions on an IDE. Then we added the chat interface to it. Then we added the Agent Mode to it. And now we have an autonomous agent, which in fact works completely asynchronously, right? So all those 4 things are now part of essentially GitHub. And by the way, it also turns out that every other tool that is also doing any form of coding is adding more and more GitHub repos. So if I have to think about GitHub monetization, we have an opportunity around just monetizing GitHub Enterprise and then we have the ability to think about GitHub Copilot, and GitHub Copilot as with all these form factors. And so that's exactly the same thing that's happening with Microsoft 365. That's the same thing that's happening with Dynamics 365. So you have to be very open to taking your data tier, your business logic tier and your UI tier and sort of being more expansive in it. As long as you do that, it's just that usage goes up, and that's what I think shows up in the results."
253947fa58da1b3fca991a204618c86f,12,Amy E. Hood,"And I think, Mark, if you wanted to think about all the things and the layers that you talked about, is really we're seeing very similar monetization tools exist in this transition too, right? There's a per user logic, there's tiers of per user. Sometimes those tiers relate to consumption, sometimes there's pure consumption models. I think you'll continue to see a blending of these. Especially as the AI model capability grows, you'll end up with ways that teams are going to want to throttle that usage, use the best models for the best job. And I think the blending of these models will continue to be something we see on a go-forward basis."
253947fa58da1b3fca991a204618c86f,13,Operator,The next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS.
253947fa58da1b3fca991a204618c86f,14,Karl Emil Keirstead,"Satya and Amy, this is the second quarter in a row of pretty material Azure upside from what sounds like an acceleration in on-prem to Azure migration activity. I'm just wondering if you can comment on the plethora of customer conversations you've had, whether there are a couple of 2 or 3 specific catalysts that are driving that migration. And how durable a trend do you think that is?"
253947fa58da1b3fca991a204618c86f,15,Satya Nadella,"Yes. Just 3 things are really happening. One is the migrations. A good example would be what I referenced in my remarks with Nestle, with the SAP instances they moved, along with a lot of the data that's associated with it and a bunch of servers. So that's kind of a classic example. I think, whether it's VMware migrations or migrations of SAP, or even just our own server migrations, they're pretty healthy. And it turns out that we're still not anywhere close to the finish line, if at best, maybe in the middle innings of that. The second thing that's also happening is cloud-native applications that are scaling. This is even excluding all of the AI stuff, just the classic cloud native e-commerce company, let's say. These are scaling in a big way. And some of those customers were not on Azure previously, but now they're increasingly there, because they have come for AI perhaps but they now stay for more than AI. And so to me, that's another thing you see in overall, what's happening across the Azure number. And then, of course, there are the new AI workloads. So those are 3 things that are all, in some sense, building on each other, but that's kind of what's driving our growth."
253947fa58da1b3fca991a204618c86f,16,Operator,The next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies.
253947fa58da1b3fca991a204618c86f,17,Brent John Thill,"Satya, back to the strength across the board in the quarter, was there anything that jumped out at you or surprised you that you didn't think you were going to see but you did see in the quarter? Just the magnitude of upside, I think, had shocked many here."
253947fa58da1b3fca991a204618c86f,18,Satya Nadella,"Yes. I don't know, Brent, if anything really surprised us. But I think what we are noticing in our own build-out of these AI applications and in general is the platform is becoming more than, ""Here is the model and here is an API. Make some calls,"" right? I mean that, in some sense, was a bit of the state-of-the-art maybe even a year ago. Whereas now you have essentially these very stateful app patterns that are emerging that require quite a bit of rethinking of even the app stack. I mean take even the storage tier stuff, right, the degree of sophistication you have, and hey, how much of an index do you really want to build by preprocessing so that your prompt engineering, or context engineering as I call it, can be better and higher quality? So I think all of that is emerging. So when I look at a product like Azure Search, Fabric and Cosmos DB, all of the things, the frameworks around it, are just becoming robust to build serious applications. And so that's what I feel great about, is the learning curve inside the company, outside the company, the diffusion of the stack, the speed with which that's emerging, that you can build applications, is much faster. I always go back and say, hey, when, I don't know, relational database came out, it took a while for people to build an ERP system, let's say. And this thing, we're kind of building pretty sophisticated applications at a very, very fast clip based on, I think, the degree of maturity that's emerging."
253947fa58da1b3fca991a204618c86f,19,Operator,The next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.
253947fa58da1b3fca991a204618c86f,20,Raimo Lenschow,"Congrats from me as well. I had one question on Copilot, and I'm obviously a happy user here at Barclays. If you think about it, the one thing that we're all realizing is that Copilot is the AI part, but data is becoming more and more important. And then from there on, we can start thinking about agents. Where is the -- what are you seeing in your customer conversations, Satya, about like that understanding that Copilot is actually just the starting point, and then, from there on, it's becoming like much, much broader?"
253947fa58da1b3fca991a204618c86f,21,Satya Nadella,"Yes. I think that that's right. Even inside of Copilot, I'm sure you're seeing it, right? You now have Analyst and Researcher, to just talk about 2 examples, and of course, people, all the third-party agents. So yes, there is a lot more of it's just not request, respond. It's about spawning essentially applications that then go do work and come back. But the UI still remains very important, right, even for asynchronous work. To instruct the asynchronous work, you need UI. And to monitor asynchronous work, you need UI. Maybe different, it may not be a chat interface. And of course, you need a way to then inspect what the asynchronous work is, right? So even take the example I was giving on GitHub. Even if you're not using GitHub Copilot to create the core check-in or the pull request, interestingly enough, we're seeing massive increase to GitHub Copilot Code Review Agent even if you used maybe Claude Code or whatever else to write the code. So that's I think what's happening across all of these systems. So you're absolutely right that you need -- it starts with some kind of a UI that's more chat focused, but it quickly goes beyond it. And you see it in M365, you see it in Dynamics 365 and you see it in GitHub."
253947fa58da1b3fca991a204618c86f,22,Operator,The next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs.
253947fa58da1b3fca991a204618c86f,23,Kasthuri Gopalan Rangan,"Amy, I want to acknowledge that, I think a few quarters ago, you said that you'll reach a point in time where you can accelerate Azure while slowing down CapEx. So you did it. But what is the outlook? When I look at the CapEx guidance for the upcoming quarter, certainly, I would view that as a positive indicator of the book of business you have for your cloud services. But how should we think about the shape of the curve of CapEx vis-a-vis Azure growth rate in the years ahead, particularly as I listen to Satya's comments on the AI stack consuming more and more infrastructure? Are we at a point where we're going to have to continue to do this and we magically wait for inference and applications to kick in and, therefore, create a richer gross margin mix? Congrats on the quarter."
253947fa58da1b3fca991a204618c86f,24,Amy E. Hood,"Thanks, Kash. Let me back up and first say, when you think about the full year comments I've made on CapEx as well as the Q1 guidance of over $30 billion, you first have to ground yourself in the fact that we have $368 billion of contracted backlog we need to deliver, not just across Azure but across the breadth of the Microsoft Cloud. So in terms of feeling good about the ROI and the growth rates and the correlation, I feel very good that the spend that we're making is correlated to basically contracted on the books business that we need to deliver and we need the teams to execute at their very best to get the capacity in place as quickly and effectively as they can. And so when you look, and we've talked about the growth rate will decline year-over-year, but at its core, our investments, particularly in short-lived assets like servers, GPUs, CPUs, networking storage, is just really correlated to the backlog we see and the curve of demand. And I talked about, my gosh, in January and said I thought we'd be in better supply demand shape by June. And now I'm saying I hope I'm in better shape by December. And that's not because we slowed CapEx. Even with accelerating the spend and trying to pull leases in and get CPUs and GPUs in the system as quickly as we can, we are still seeing demand improve. And so I am not as focused, Kash, on trying to pick a date at which revenue growth and CapEx growth will meet and cross. I'm focused on building backlog, building business and delivering capacity, which we are seeing has a good ROI today in terms of our ability to get that done. So I don't want people to get overly focused on a pivot point. Because when you're in sort of these expansive moments, picking a data point usually means you're going to pick to be too conservative in terms of market share gain and in terms of winning. And so I tend to put my energy more there."
253947fa58da1b3fca991a204618c86f,25,Satya Nadella,"Yes. I think one of the other things, Kash, is that -- I think I said this in the previous earnings as well, which is the difference between a hoster and a hyperscaler is software. And the same is going to be true here. That GPT4o example I gave is all software, right, the optimization even in the last year. So we know how to use the software skills to take any piece of hardware and make it multiple x better. And so that's kind of where the yield will come. But as Amy said, while you're really going and building out the plant, you don't want to sort of serialize it. You just want to go in and paddle on all of these fronts, and that's sort of what will compound over time."
253947fa58da1b3fca991a204618c86f,26,Amy E. Hood,"And I do think it's important, when Satya talks about the software layer, he is talking about, in his comments, to connect this back to the compounding S curves. And so I would remind people, that is something that we saw through the prior cloud transition, it's how we operated through that one. And the same sort of skills and logic done at an even faster pace is what will apply the same transition."
253947fa58da1b3fca991a204618c86f,27,Operator,The next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo.
253947fa58da1b3fca991a204618c86f,28,Michael James Turrin,"Congrats from me as well on the metrics working in concert here. Amy, maybe on margin. Impressive to hear expectations for flat operating margin in the upcoming year as you absorb some of the mix shift towards Azure and some of the more AI-focused offerings. Can you speak in more detail just around your ability to manage those trade-offs and offset some of the mix shift? And I'm wondering specifically just on any productivity gains you're seeing from leveraging AI internally that you'd highlight, or anything else you'd just mention underpinning the full year expectation there?"
253947fa58da1b3fca991a204618c86f,29,Amy E. Hood,"Thanks, Michael. I think really the area to focus on is, when you think about margin, I think sometimes people get a lot of energy around cost control as a driver of margin. The other driver is to focus on making sure you deliver a great product that's competitive and innovative and can take share, because that drives revenue. And revenue itself, and revenue growth as you all know better, even perhaps than I do, is a durable way to see margin improvement. It builds on itself. That being said, the second thing I would point to is really what I talked to Kash a little bit about before, Satya and I both mentioned it, is applying all of our skill set here to deliver efficiencies, whether that's at whatever layer of the stack that exists, the S curves compound, and we are doing that work and we're focused on it at the same time we're doing the build out. So you'll see improvements there even as we continue to invest. And then, of course, it's about continuing to have great talent here focused on products and opportunities where we have the biggest markets and the most likelihood of success. And so when we have those 3 things happen and the energy is right and the focus is there, it gives me confidence in terms of margin delivery. But make no mistake, it starts and ends really with product, which is what we're really focused on here, and delivering that to customers."

fa9d3f5cf6b2b4e5953e4d18206a81c9,3,Satya Nadella,"Thank you, Jonathan. It was a very strong start to our fiscal year. Microsoft Cloud revenue surpassed $49 billion, up 26% year-over-year. And our commercial RPO increased over 50% to nearly $400 billion with a weighted average duration of only 2 years. We are seeing increasing demand and diffusion of our AI platform and family of Copilots, which is fueling our investments across both capital and talent. When it comes to infrastructure, we're building a planet scale cloud and an AI factory, maximizing tokens per dollar per watt while supporting the sovereignty needs of customers and countries. We are innovating rapidly across the family of Copilots spanning the high-value domains of information work, coding, security, science, health and consumer. And as you saw yesterday, we closed a new definitive agreement with OpenAI, marking the next chapter in what is one of the most successful partnerships and investments our industry has ever seen. This is a great milestone for both companies and we continue to benefit mutually from each other's growth across multiple dimensions. Already, we have roughly 10x-ed our investment. OpenAI has contracted an incremental $250 billion of Azure services, our rev share, exclusive IP rights and API exclusivity for Azure continue until AGI or through 2030. And we have extended the model and product IP rights through 2032. And we are also energized to innovate and pursue AI advancements with both talent and compute investments that have real-world impact. With that, let's turn to our momentum across our AI platform and Copilots as well as with agents. We have the most expansive data center fleet for the AI era, and we are adding capacity at an unprecedented scale. We will increase our total AI capacity by over 80% this year and roughly double our total data center footprint over the next 2 years, reflecting the demand signals we see. Just this quarter, we announced the world's most powerful AI data center, Fairwater in Wisconsin, which will go online next year and scale to 2 gigawatts alone. And we have deployed the world's first large-scale cluster of NVIDIA GB300s. We are building a fungible fleet that's been continuously modernized and spans all stages of the AI life cycle from pretraining to post training to synthetic data generation and inference. And it also goes beyond GenAI workloads to recommendation engines, databases and streaming. We're optimizing this fleet across silicon systems and software to maximize performance and efficiency. It's this combination of fungibility and continuous optimization that allows us to deliver the best ROI and TCO for us and our customers. For example, during the quarter, we increased the token throughput for GPT-4.1 and GPT-5, two of the most widely used models by over 30% per GPU. We also have the most comprehensive digital sovereignty platform. Azure customers in 33 countries are now developing their own cloud and AI capabilities within their borders to meet local data residency requirements. In Germany, for example, OpenAI and SAP will rely on Azure to deliver new AI solutions to the public sector. On top of this infrastructure, we are building Azure AI Foundry to help customers build their own AI apps and agents. We have 80,000 customers, including 80% of the Fortune 500. We offer developers and enterprise access to over 11,000 models more than any other vendor, including as of this quarter, OpenAI's GPT-5 as well as xAI's Grok 4. For example, Ralph Lauren used Foundry to build conversational shopping experience in its app, enabling customers to describe what they're looking for and get personalized recommendations. And OpenEvidence used Foundry to create its AI-powered clinical assistant which surfaces relevant medical information to physicians and help streamline charting. When it comes to our first-party models, we are excited by the performance of our new MAI models for text, voice and image generation, which debuted among the top in the industry leader boards. And we continue to make great progress with our Phi family of SLMs, which now have been downloaded over 60 million times, up 3x year-over-year. Beyond models in Foundry, we are providing everything developers need to design, customize and manage AI applications and agents at scale. Our new Microsoft Agent Framework helps developers orchestrate multi-agent systems with compliance, observability and deep integration out of the box. For example, KPMG used the framework to modernize the audit process, connecting agents to internal data with enterprise-grade governance and observability. These kinds of real production scale AI deployments are driving Azure's overall growth. And once again, this quarter, Azure took share. Now let's turn to applications and agents we ourselves are building on this platform. We now have 900 million monthly active users of our AI features across our products. And our first-party family of Copilots now has surpassed 150 million monthly active users across the information work, coding, security, science, health and consumer. When it comes to information work, we continue to innovate with Microsoft 365 Copilot. Copilot is becoming the UI for the agentic AI experience. We have integrated chat and agentic workflows into everyday tools like Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Teams. Just 9 months since release, tens of millions of users across Microsoft 365 customer base are already using chat. Adoption is accelerating rapidly, growing 50% quarter-over-quarter, and we continue to see usage intensity increased. This quarter, we also introduced Agent Mode, which turns single prompts into export quality Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentation and then iterate to deliver the final product much like agent mode in coding tools today. We're thrilled by the early response, including third-party benchmarks that rank it best-in-class. Beyond individual productivity, Copilot is multiplayer, with Teams mode announced this week, you can now invite colleagues into a Copilot conversation. And our collaborative agents like Facilitator and Project Manager, prep meeting agendas, take notes, capture decision, kick off group tasks. We are seeing a growing Copilot agent ecosystem with top ISVs like Adobe, Asana, Jira, LexisNexis, SAP, ServiceNow, Snowflake and Workday, all building their own agents that connect to Copilot. And customers are also building agents for their mission-critical business processes and workflows using tools like Copilot Studio and integrating them into Copilot. The overall number of agent users doubled quarter-over-quarter. And just yesterday, we announced App Builder, a new Copilot agent that lets anyone create and deploy task-specific apps and agents in minutes grounded in Microsoft 365 context. All this innovation is driving our momentum. Customers continue to adopt Microsoft 365 Copilot at a faster rate than any other new Microsoft 365 suite, all up more than 90% of the Fortune 500 now use Microsoft 365 Copilot, Accenture, Bristol-Myers Squibb, EY Global and the U.K.'s Tax and Payments and Customs Authority all purchased over 15,000 seats this quarter. Lloyds Banking Group has deployed 30,000 seats, saving each employee an average of 46 minutes daily. And a large majority of our enterprise customers continue to come back to purchase more seats. Our partner, PwC, alone added 155,000 seats this quarter and now has over 200,000 deployed across its global operations. In just 6 months, PwC employees interacted with Microsoft 365 Copilot over 30 million times, and they credit this agentic transformation with saving millions of hours an employee productivity. When it comes to coding, GitHub Copilot is the most popular AI pair programmer now with over 26 million users. For example, tens of thousands of developers at AMD use GitHub Copilot, accepting hundreds of thousands of lines of code suggestions each month and crediting it with saving months of development time. All up, GitHub is now home to over 180 million developers and the platform is growing at the fastest rate in its history, adding a developer every second. 80% of new developers on GitHub start with Copilot within the first week. Overall, the rise of AI coding agents is driving record usage with over 500 million pull requests merged over the past year. And just yesterday, at GitHub Universe, we introduced Agent HQ. GitHub Copilot and Agent HQ is the organizing layer for all coding agent, extending GitHub privatives like PRs, issues, actions to coding agents from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Cognition, xAI as well as OSS and in-house models. GitHub now provides a single mission control to launch, manage and review these agents, each operating from its own branch with built-in controls, observability and governance. We are building a similar system in security with over 3 dozen agents in Copilot integrated across Entra, Defender, Purview and Intune. For example, with our Phishing Triage Agent in Defender, studies show that analysts can be up to 6.5x more efficient in detecting malicious mails. In health, Dragon Copilot helps providers automate critical workflows. This quarter alone, we helped document over 17 million patient encounters, up nearly 5x year-over-year. More than 650 health care organizations have purchased our ambient listening tech to date, including University of Michigan Health where over 1,000 physicians are actively using it. Finally, when it comes to AI consumer experiences, we are excited about all the progress Copilot is making, starting with Windows. Every Windows 11 PC now is an AI PC. Just 2 weeks ago, we introduced new ways to speak naturally to your computer, including a Copilot wake word. With vision, Copilot sees what you see on your screen and you can have a real-time conversation about it. And with action, it takes real action on your behalf, interacting with both web and desktop apps. In Edge, we are introducing first-of-its-kind AI features to automate multistep workflows within the browser and help you pick up right where you left off. Edge now has taken share for 18 consecutive quarters. In Bing, our overview pages now include embedded conversational capabilities, we took share again in search. And daily users of our Copilot consumer app increased nearly 50% quarter-over-quarter. Among many updates we made last week is groups, which turns Copilot for the first time into a shared experience. We also are creating a great consumer subscription offer with Microsoft 365 premium. It brings together our Office applications and advanced Copilot features with high usage limits, giving individuals the flexibility to bring their own AI to work in a secure way. Finally, in gaming, Copilot provides a voice-first immersive experience across PC, mobile and our new Xbox Ally. Beyond our family of Copilots and AI platform, we are seeing strong momentum across the portfolio. Cloud migrations are accelerating. In data and analytics, Fabric revenue grew 60%, which is faster than any other data and analytics platform in the industry. We now have 28,000 paid Fabric customers. In databases, SQL, DB, hyperscale revenue was up nearly 75%, 50% in Cosmos DB. In Business Applications, Dynamics 365 gained share. In security, our end-to-end stack is now informed by 100 trillion daily signals. 1 billion monthly active users of Entra, 16 billion Copilot interactions audited by Purview, up 72% quarter-over-quarter. 40,000 Sentinel customers, and we took share across all categories we serve in security. In LinkedIn, nearly 1.3 billion members. And finally, in gaming, we expanded our reach across every endpoint focused on our high-margin content and services. We launched critically acclaimed games like Keeper, Ninja Gaiden 4 and Outer Worlds 2, reaching 155 million monthly active users. Minecraft, an all-time high, and set new record for overall content and services revenue for the quarter. We also saw a great response to Xbox Ally launch 2 weeks ago and set new records for players on PC. In closing, our planet-scale Cloud and AI factory together with Copilots across high-value domains is driving broad diffusion and real-world impact. And we continue to increase our investments in AI across both capital and talent to meet the massive opportunity ahead. With that, let me turn it over to Amy to walk through our financial results and outlook, and I look forward to rejoining for your questions."
fa9d3f5cf6b2b4e5953e4d18206a81c9,4,Amy Hood,"Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. First, as you heard from Satya, we were pleased to announce the next phase of our partnership with OpenAI yesterday. They continue to choose Microsoft to power their workloads. And together, we remain committed to driving innovation that meets real-world needs. Our Q1 results were not impacted by the deal signed this week. Now on to the quarter, we delivered a strong start to our fiscal year, exceeding expectations across revenue, operating income and earnings per share. We also saw continued share gains across many of our businesses, demonstrating our leadership position in key markets. This quarter, revenue was $77.7 billion, up 18% and 17% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 18% and 16% in constant currency, while operating income increased 24% and 22% in constant currency. And earnings per share was $4.13 and an increase of 23% and 21% in constant currency when adjusted for the impact of our investments in OpenAI. FX impact was roughly in line with guidance. Company gross margin percentage was 69%, down slightly year-over-year, driven by investments in AI, including the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure and the growing usage of our AI product features. This was partially offset by ongoing efficiency gains, particularly in Azure and M365 Commercial cloud. Operating expenses increased 5% and 4% in constant currency, driven by investments in Cloud and AI engineering, including compute capacity and AI talent to support product development across the portfolio. Operating margins increased year-over-year to 49% and were ahead of expectations with stronger-than-anticipated results and high-margin businesses this quarter. When adjusted for the impact from our investments in OpenAI, other income and expense was $401 million as interest income more than offset interest expense, which includes the interest of payments related to data center finance leases. Capital expenditures were $34.9 billion, driven by growing demand for our Cloud and AI offerings. This quarter, roughly half of our spend was on short-lived assets, primarily GPUs and CPUs, to support increasing Azure platform demand, growing first-party apps at AI solutions, accelerating R&D by our product teams as well as continued replacement for end-of-life server and networking equipment. The remaining spend was for long-lived assets that will support monetization for the next 15 years and beyond, including $11.1 billion of finance leases that are primarily for large data center sites. And cash paid for PP&E was $19.4 billion. As a reminder, the difference between total CapEx and cash paid for PP&E is primarily due to finance leases as well as the normal timing of goods received, but not yet paid. Cash flow from operations was $45.1 billion, up 32%, driven by strong Cloud billings and collections, partially offset by higher supplier payments. And free cash flow increased 33% to $25.7 billion with minimal impact from a sequential increase in CapEx, given the higher mix of finance leases. And finally, we returned $10.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now to our commercial results. Commercial bookings increased 112% and 111% in constant currency and were significantly ahead of expectations, driven by Azure commitments from OpenAI as well as continued growth in the number of $100 million-plus contracts for both Azure and M365. These results do not include any impact from the incremental $250 billion Azure commitments from OpenAI announced yesterday. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased to $392 billion and was up 51% year-over-year. The balance has nearly doubled over the past 2 years. And even with this growth, our weighted average duration has been relatively stable at approximately 2 years. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $49.1 billion, ahead of expectations and grew 26% and 25% in constant currency. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage was slightly better than expected at 68% and down year-over-year due to the investments in AI that were partially offset by ongoing efficiency gains as noted earlier. Now to segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $33 billion and grew 17% and 14% in constant currency. M365 Commercial Cloud revenue increased 17% and 15% in constant currency with 1 point of benefit from in-period revenue recognition. Year-over-year growth was driven by both ARPU and seats with ARPU growth again led by E5 and M365 Copilot. Paid M365 Commercial seats grew 6% year-over-year with installed base expansion across all customer segments though primarily in our small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings. M365 Commercial Products revenue increased 17% and 14% in constant currency, ahead of expectations due to higher-than-expected Office 2024 transactional purchasing. M365 Consumer Cloud revenue increased 26% and 25% in constant currency, again driven by ARPU growth. M365 consumer subscriptions grew 7% to over 90 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 10% and 9% in constant currency driven by Marketing Solutions. The Talent Solutions business was impacted by continued weakness in the hiring market. Dynamics 365 revenue increased 18% and 16% in constant currency with continued growth across all workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 19% and 16% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased driven by efficiency gains in M365 Commercial Cloud that were partially offset by investments in AI including the impact of growing usage in M365 Copilot chat. Operating expenses increased 6% and 5% in constant currency, and operating income increased 24% and 20% in constant currency. Operating margins increased 3 points year-over-year to 62%, driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier as well as improved operating leverage. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $30.9 billion and grew 28% and 27% in constant currency. In Azure and other Cloud services, where we continue to see accelerating demand, revenue grew 40% and 39% in constant currency. Results were ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected growth in our core infrastructure business, primarily from our largest customers. Azure AI services revenue was generally in line with expectations, and this quarter, demand again exceeded supply across workloads, even as we brought more capacity online. In our on-premise server business, revenue increased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency. Results were ahead of expectations, driven by transactional purchasing of Windows Server 2025. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and 19% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased year-over-year, driven by investments in AI that were partially offset by efficiency gains in Azure. Operating expenses increased 4% and operating income grew 27%. Operating margins were 43%, down only slightly year-over-year as increased investments in AI were mostly offset by improved operating leverage. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $13.8 billion and grew 4%. Windows OEM and Devices revenue increased 6% year-over-year, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by strong demand ahead of Windows 10 end of support as well as a benefit from inventory levels that remain elevated. Search and news advertising revenue ex TAC increased 16% and 15% in constant currency, driven by growth in volume as well as the continued benefit from third-party partnerships that was better than expected. And in gaming, revenue decreased 2% and 3% in constant currency against a strong prior year comparable. Xbox content and services revenue increased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency, driven by better-than-expected performance from third-party content. Segment gross margin dollars increased 11% and 10% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased year-over-year driven by sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 4% and 3% in constant currency, and operating income increased 18% and 16% in constant currency. Operating margins increased 3 points year-over-year to 30% driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier. Now moving to our Q2 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total revenue growth by 2 points. Within the segments, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by 2 points in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and 1 point in More Personal Computing. We expect FX to increase COGS and operating expense growth by 1 point. Starting with the total company, we expect revenue of USD 79.5 billion to USD 80.6 billion or growth of 14% to 16%. We expect COGS of USD 26.35 billion to USD 26.55 billion or growth of 21% to 22%. And operating expense of USD 17.3 billion to USD 17.4 billion, growth of 7% to 8%. Operating margins should be relatively flat year-over-year and down sequentially, aligned with historic seasonality. Now other income and expense. The combination of OpenAI's conversion to a public benefit corp and the ongoing nature of our partnership will result in increased volatility. Therefore, going forward, we'll provide our outlook, excluding any impact from our investments in OpenAI. On that basis, in Q2, other income and expense is estimated to be roughly $100 million as interest income will more than offset interest expense. And we expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. Next, capital expenditures. With accelerating demand and a growing RPO balance, we're increasing our spend on GPUs and CPUs. Therefore, total spend will increase sequentially, and we now expect the FY '26 growth rate to be higher than FY '25. As a reminder, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure build-outs and the timing of delivery of finance leases. Next, our commercial business. In commercial bookings, we expect healthy growth in the core business on a low expiry base when adjusted for the OpenAI contracts in the prior year. And we expect commercial bookings will be positively impacted by the significant OpenAI commitments announced yesterday. As a reminder, larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 66%, down year-over-year, driven by the continued investments in AI as well as the mix shift to Azure. Now to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of USD 33.3 billion to USD 33.6 billion or growth of 13% to 14%. In M365 Commercial Cloud, we expect revenue growth to be between 13% and 14% in constant currency, with business trends that remain relatively stable quarter-over-quarter. ARPU growth will again be driven by E5 and M365 Copilot. M365 Commercial products revenue growth should be in the low to mid-single digits. As a reminder, M365 Commercial products includes components that can be variable due to the in-period revenue recognition dynamics. M365 Consumer cloud revenue growth should be in the mid-20s driven by growth in ARPU. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth of approximately 10%. And in Dynamics 365, we expect revenue growth to be in the mid- to high teens with continued growth across all workloads. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue of USD 32.25 billion to USD 32.55 billion or growth of 26% to 27%. In Azure, we expect Q2 revenue growth of approximately 37% in constant currency as demand remains significantly ahead of the capacity we have available. And while we're accelerating the amount of capacity we're bringing online, we will continue to balance Azure revenue growth with the growing needs across our first-party apps and AI solutions, our own R&D efforts and the end-of-life server replacements. Therefore, we now expect to be capacity constrained through at least the end of our fiscal year. As a reminder, there can be quarterly variability in the year-on-year growth rates depending on the timing of capacity delivery and when it comes online as well as from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid-single digits with ongoing customer shift to cloud offerings. In More Personal Computing. We expect revenue to be in the USD 13.95 billion to USD 14.45 billion. Windows OEM and Devices revenue should decline in the mid-single digits. We expect continued momentum from Windows 10 end of support, although growth rates will be impacted by elevated inventory levels at the end of Q1 that we expect to come down through the quarter. Therefore, Windows OEM revenue should decline low to mid-single digits. The range of potential outcomes remains wider than normal. Devices revenue should decline year-over-year. Search and news advertising ex TAC revenue growth should be in the low double digits, down sequentially as growth rates normalize following the benefit from third-party partnerships noted earlier. Growth will continue to be driven by volume and revenue per search across Edge and Bing. And in Xbox content and services, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid-single digits against the prior year comparable that benefited from strong first-party performance, partially offset by growth in subscriptions. And hardware revenue should decline year-over-year. And in closing, demand signals across bookings, RPO and product usage are accelerating faster than we expected. We're investing in infrastructure, AI talent and product innovation to capture that momentum and expand our leadership position. And we remain focused on delivering real value to our customers that results in durable revenue growth for the long term. With that, let's go to Q&A, Jonathan."
fa9d3f5cf6b2b4e5953e4d18206a81c9,5,Jonathan Neilson,"Thanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?"
fa9d3f5cf6b2b4e5953e4d18206a81c9,6,Operator,[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.
fa9d3f5cf6b2b4e5953e4d18206a81c9,7,Keith Weiss,"Congratulations on another outstanding quarter. And if I'm looking at Microsoft, this is 2 quarters in a row, we're really seeing results that are well ahead of anybody's expectations when we were thinking about this company a year ago or 5 years ago, 111% in Commercial bookings growth was not on anybody's bingo card, if you will, yet the stock is underperforming in the broader market. And the question I have is kind of getting at the zeitgeist that I think is weighing on the stock. And is something about to change? And I think AGI is kind of a nomenclature or a shorthand for that. And it's something that still included in your guys' OpenAI agreement. So Satya, when we think about AGI or we think about how application and computing architectures are changing, is there anything that you see on the horizon, whether it's AGI or something else, that could potentially change what appears to be a really strong positioning for Microsoft in the marketplace today where that strength will perhaps weaken on a go-forward basis. Is there anything that you're worrying about in that evolution and particularly the evolution of these generative AI models."
fa9d3f5cf6b2b4e5953e4d18206a81c9,8,Satya Nadella,"Thank you, Keith, for the question. So here's what I would say, I think there are 2 parts. We feel very, very good about even this, I'd say, the new agreement that we now have with OpenAI because I think even, it just creates more certainty to all of the IP relationship we have as it relates to even this definition of AGI. But beyond that, I think your question touches on something that's pretty important, which is how are these AI systems going to truly be deployed in the real world and make a real difference and make a return for both the customers who are deploying them and then obviously, the providers of these systems. And I think the best way to characterize the situation is that even as the intelligence capability increases, let's even say, exponentially like model version over model version, the problem is it's always going to still be jagged, right? I think the term people use is the jagged intelligence, even -- or spiky intelligence, right? So you may even have a capability that's fantastic at a particular task, but it may not uniformly grow. So what is required is in fact, these systems, whether it is GitHub Agent HQ or the M365 Copilot system. Don't think of this as a product. Think of it as a system that in some sense smooths out those jagged edges, and really helps the capability. I mean just to give you a flavor for it, right? So if I am in M365 Copilot, I can generate an Excel spreadsheet. The good news is now an Excel spreadsheet does understand Office JS, has the formulas in it. It feels like, wow, it is a great spreadsheet created by a good model. The more interesting thing is I can go into agent mode in Excel and iterate on that model. And yet, it will stay on rail. It won't go off rail, it will be able to do the iteration. Then I can even give it to the analyst agent, and then it will even make sense of it like a data analyst would of our Excel model. The reason I say all of that is because that's the type of construction that will be needed even when the model is magical, all powerful. I think we will be in this jagged intelligence phase for a long time. So one of the fundamental things that these -- whether it's GitHub, whether it's security, whether it's M365, the 3 main domains we're in, we feel very, very good about building these as organizing layers for agents to help customers. And by the way, that's the same thing that we want to put into Foundry for our third-party customers. So that's kind of how people will build these multi-agent systems. So I feel actually pretty good about both the progress in AI. I don't think AGI as defined at least by us in our contract is ever going to be achieved anytime soon. But I do believe we can drive a lot of value for customers with advances in AI models by building these systems. So it's kind of the real question that needs to be well understood. And I feel very, very confident about our ability to make progress."
fa9d3f5cf6b2b4e5953e4d18206a81c9,9,Operator,The next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies.
fa9d3f5cf6b2b4e5953e4d18206a81c9,10,Brent Thill,"Amy, on the bookings blowout. I guess many are somewhat concerned about concentration risk. And I think you noted a number of $100 million contracts, not to go into a lot of detail, but can you just give us a sense of what you're seeing in that 51% RPO and 110-plus percent bookings growth that gives you confidence about what you're seeing in terms of the breadth and extent of some of these deals on a global basis."
fa9d3f5cf6b2b4e5953e4d18206a81c9,11,Amy Hood,"Thanks, Brent. A couple of things to maybe take a step back on RPO. With a nearly $400 billion balance, we've been trying to help people understand sort of how to think about really the breadth of that. It covers numerous products. It covers customers of all sizes. It -- that's been a balance that we've been growing obviously at a good clip. But what people need to realize is it sits across multiple products because of the things Satya is talking about around creating systems and where we're investing. And if you're going to have that type of balance and then more importantly, have the weighted average duration be 2 years, it means that most of that is being consumed in relatively short order. People are not consuming, and I say this broadly, unless there's value. And I think this is why we keep coming back to, are we creating real-world value in our AI platforms, in our AI solutions and apps and systems. And so I think the sort of the way to think about RPO is it's been building across a number of customers. We're thrilled to have OpenAI be a piece of that. We're learning a ton and building leading systems because of it that are being used at scale that benefits every other customer. And so it's why we've tried to give a little bit more color to that RPO balance because I do understand that there have been a lot of concerns or questions about is it long dated, is it coming over a long period of time. And hopefully, this is helpful for people to realize that these are contracts being signed by customers who intend to use it in relatively short order. And at that type of scale, I think that's a pretty remarkable execution."
fa9d3f5cf6b2b4e5953e4d18206a81c9,12,Operator,The next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research.
fa9d3f5cf6b2b4e5953e4d18206a81c9,13,Mark Moerdler,"Congratulations on the quarter. It's pretty amazing what you guys are doing. Satya and Amy, I'd like to ask you the #1 question I receive, whether from investors or at AI conferences I attend, how much confidence do you have that the software, even the consumer [indiscernible] business can monetize all the investments we're seeing globally? Or frankly, are we in a bubble? In fact, Amy, what would be the factors you'd be watching for to assure that you're not overbuilding for current demand and the demand will sustain."
fa9d3f5cf6b2b4e5953e4d18206a81c9,14,Amy Hood,"Maybe I'll start, Satya and then you could add. Let me talk a little bit about maybe connecting a couple of the dots because with $400 billion of RPO, that's sort of short-dated as we talked about, our needs to continue to build out the infrastructure is very high. And that's for booked business today. That is not any new booked business we started trying to accomplish on October 1, right? And so the way to think about that, and you saw it this quarter in particular, and as we talked about '26, the remainder, number one, we're pivoting toward -- increasingly, we talked about this short-lived assets, both GPUs and CPUs, Again, we talk about all these workloads are burning both in terms of app building. Now when that happens, short-lived assets generally are done to match sort of the duration of the contracts or the duration of your expectation of those contracts. And so I sometimes think when people think about risk, they're not realizing that most of the lifetimes of these and the lifetime of the contracts are very similar. And so when you think about having revenue and the bookings and coming on the balance sheet, the depreciation of short-lived assets, they're actually quite matched, Mark. And as you know, we've spent the past few years not actually being short GPUs and CPUs per se, we were short the space or the power is the language we used to put them in. So we spent a lot of time building out that infrastructure. Now we're continuing to do that also using leases. Those are very long-lived assets, as we've talked about 15 to 20 years. And over that period of time, do I have confidence that we'll need to use all of that, it is very high. And so when I think about sort of balancing those things, seeing the pivot to GPU, CPU short-lived, seeing the pivot in terms of how those are being utilized, we are -- and I said this now, we've been short now for many quarters. I thought we were going to catch up, we are not. Demand is increasing. It is not increasing in just one place. It is increasing across many places. We're seeing usage increases in products. We are seeing new products launch that are getting increasing usage, and increasing usage very quickly. When people see real value, they actually commit real usage. And I sometimes think this is where this cycle needs to be thought through completely is that when you see these kind of demand signals and we know we're behind, we do need to spend. But we're spending with a different amount of confidence in usage patterns and in bookings, and I feel very good about that. I have said we are now likely to be short capacity to serve the most important things we need to do, which is Azure, our first-party applications. We need to invest in product R&D and we're doing end-of-life replacements in the fleet. So we're going to spend to make sure that happens. It's about modernization. It's about high quality. It's about service delivery, and it's about meeting demand. And so I feel good about doing that, and I feel good that we've been able to do it so efficiently and with a growing book of business behind it."
fa9d3f5cf6b2b4e5953e4d18206a81c9,15,Satya Nadella,"Yes. The only thing I would add to what Amy captured was, if you sort of look out, there are 2 things that matter, I think, and that are critical in terms of how we think about our allocation of capital, also our R&D. One is how efficient is our planet-scale token factory, right? I mean that's at the end of the day, what you have to do. And in order to do that, you have to start with building out a very fungible fleet. It's not like we're building one data center in one region in the world that's mega scale. We are building it out across the globe for inference, for pre-training, for post-training, for RL, for data [indiscernible] or what have you. So therefore, that's the fungibility is super important. The second thing that we're also doing is continually modernizing the fleet. It's not like we buy one version of, say, NVIDIA and load up for all the gigawatts we have. Each year, you buy, you write the Moore's Law, you continuously modernize and depreciate it. And that means you also use software to grow efficiency. I talked about, I think, 30% improvement on both serving up GPT-4.1 and 5.0, right? That's software. That's sort of -- and by the way, it's helpful on A100s, it's helpful on GB200s, and it will be helpful on GB300s. That's the beauty of having the efficiency of the fleet. So keep improving utilization, keep improving the efficiency. So that's what you do in the token factory. The other aspect, which Amy spoke to is we have some of the best agent systems that matter in the high-value domains, right? It's in information work. That's the Copilot system. Coding, I mean, I should also say one of the things I like about Copilot is, I mean, Copilot ARPU is compared to M365 ARPUs, right? It's expansive. The same thing that happened between server and cloud like we used to always say, well, is it zero-sum, it turned out that the cloud was so much more expansive to the server market. The same thing is happening in AI because first, you could say, hey, our ARPUs are too low when it comes to M365 or you could say we have the opportunity with AI to be much more expansive. Same thing with tools, right? I mean, tooling -- the tools business was not like a leading business, whereas coding business is going to be one of the most expansive AI systems. And so we feel very good about being in that category. Same thing with security, same thing with health. So we have -- and in consumer, one of the things is it's not just about ads, it's ads plus subscriptions that also opens up opportunity for us. So when I look at the entirety of these high-value agent systems and when we look at the efficiency of and fungibility of our fleet, that's what gives us the confidence to invest, both the capital and the R&D talent to go after this opportunity."
fa9d3f5cf6b2b4e5953e4d18206a81c9,16,Operator,The next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS.
fa9d3f5cf6b2b4e5953e4d18206a81c9,17,Karl Keirstead,"Okay. This one is for Amy. Amy, I certainly don't want to take you down too complex an accounting path with this question, but the investment in OpenAI that sits in other income at $4.1 billion is so large that I think the audience could -- listening in could benefit from a little bit more color about what that is. It feels like it's so much larger than you were running through other income in prior quarters that it mustn't just be your share of the OpenAI losses. So could you just describe that? And what we can expect in subsequent quarters? And whether this signals any kind of accounting change?"
fa9d3f5cf6b2b4e5953e4d18206a81c9,18,Amy Hood,"The Q1 number was not impacted at all by the new agreement that was put in place. Let me first say that. Secondly, that increased loss was all due to our percentage of losses in OpenAI due to the equity method. So just to be very clear. So there is not anything there that is not the increased losses from OpenAI."
fa9d3f5cf6b2b4e5953e4d18206a81c9,19,Operator,The next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.
fa9d3f5cf6b2b4e5953e4d18206a81c9,20,Mark Murphy,"So we seem to be entering into a new era where the contractual commitments from a small number of AI natives are just incredibly large, not only in absolute terms, but sometimes relative to the size of the companies themselves. For instance, contracts worth hundreds of billions of dollars that are 20x their current revenue scale. Philosophically, how do you evaluate the ability of those companies to follow through on these commitments? And how do you think about placing guardrails on customer concentration for any single entity?"
fa9d3f5cf6b2b4e5953e4d18206a81c9,21,Satya Nadella,"Yes. Maybe I'll start and then Amy, you can add. I mean it goes back a little bit, Mark, to what I said about building first, the asset itself such that it's most fungible. And then to recognize the strength of even sort of our portfolio, we have a third-party business, we have a first-party business, we have third-party also spread between enterprise, digital natives, I always felt that we need a balance there because it may start with digital natives. They're always going to be the early adopters. You always have the hit app of the generation. And then -- essentially then it spreads throughout. The enterprise adoption cycle is just starting and so therefore, having the -- over the arc of time, I think that third-party balance of customers will only increase. But it's great to have the hit first-party apps in the beginning because you can build scale that then if it's a fungible and that's where the key is. You don't want to build for a digital native in -- as if you're just doing hosting for them. You want to build. That's where -- I think some of the decision-making of ours is probably getting better understood. What do we say yes to, what do we say no to. I think there was a lot of confusion, hopefully by now, anyone who switched on would figure this out. And so that's, I think, one thing we're doing on the third party. But the 1 -- first party is probably where a lot of our leverage comes and it's not even about one hit app on our first-party even. Our portfolio of stuff which I just walked through in the earlier answer, gives us, again, the confidence that between that mix, we will be able to use our fleet to the maximum. And remember, these assets, especially the data centers and so on are long assets, right? There will be many refresh cycles for any one of these when it comes to the gear. So I feel that once you think about all those dimensions, the concentration risk gets mitigated by being thoughtful about how you really ensure the build is for the broad customer base."
fa9d3f5cf6b2b4e5953e4d18206a81c9,22,Amy Hood,"And maybe just to help with another angle that I think, Satya helped a lot is that when you think about concentration risk or delivering to any customer, you have to remember that because we're talking about this very large flexible fleet that can be used for anyone and for any purpose, 1P, 3P, and including our commercial cloud, by the way, which I should be quite clear on, it is pretty flexible in every regard, you have to remember that the CPU and GPU and the storage gear, doesn't come into play until the contracts start happening. And so you're right, some of these large contracts have delivery dates over time. So you get a lot of lead time in being able to say, ""Oh, what's the status?"" And so I think we're pretty thoughtful around what's always gone in our RPO balance, and then considerate of that. There's always been that taken into account when we publish that bookings on brand, publish the RPO balance."
fa9d3f5cf6b2b4e5953e4d18206a81c9,23,Operator,The next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank.
fa9d3f5cf6b2b4e5953e4d18206a81c9,24,Brad Zelnick,"And I'll echo my congrats on an amazing start to the year. Amy, is there any way to quantify or frame the revenue impact of Azure being short on capacity? And while I appreciate the constraints you face are broad across the industry, is there risk of workloads going elsewhere? And how do you mitigate that?"
fa9d3f5cf6b2b4e5953e4d18206a81c9,25,Amy Hood,"Yes, Brad, it's a great question. It's always hard to quantify precisely what would have been the revenue impact in quarter. But I would offer a way to think about it is Azure probably does bear most of the revenue impact. Because when you think about real priorities that you have to fill first, it's obviously the increasing usage and adoption and sales we've seen of M365 Copilot and the usage of Copilot chat, which we've seen very different patterns, which we're encouraged by. It's the adoption of security features. It's the GitHub momentum. And so when you're thinking about it, that is where and it is a priority for us to allocate resourcing there first. And so you are right to ask how do I think about that. We've worked very hard to try to mitigate it as best we can, but we have been short in Azure, and we've been clear on it. And I would say the other 2 priorities that I haven't mentioned maybe as much before is also just making sure our product teams and the AI talent that we've been able to hire into the company really over the past 1.5 years have access also to significant capacity because we're seeing it make the product better in a loop that is adding great benefit today into products people are using today for real-world work. And so we are making that a priority to make sure our research teams have that as well as our product engineering teams. And yes, it does impact Azure directly. That is the place where you see that prioritization. But I think it's probably hard for me to give an exact number, but it is safe to say that the number could be higher."
fa9d3f5cf6b2b4e5953e4d18206a81c9,26,Operator,The last question will come from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs.
fa9d3f5cf6b2b4e5953e4d18206a81c9,27,Kasthuri Rangan,"Amy, I just wanted to congratulate you, I think you said before that it is possible to accelerate Azure growth while getting efficient with margins and you've done it. Congrats on that. I have one for you, Satya. With respect to the elephant in the room, following just being a little more direct, following up on Keith Weiss' question. There's talk that another hyperscaler came in and took away the business that was rightfully Microsoft's. I'm sure that there is a different point of view here. I'm wondering if you could offer some perspective on your criteria to -- is it about a certain volume of business that you wish to execute on the Microsoft paper? Or is it something broader than that, that I don't think maybe people fully appreciate the terminal value that Microsoft will have on its balance sheet at the end of these contracts, which I think is probably being underestimated as you have a full stack and you've got the multiple vectors to monetize, be it databases, Foundry. And to your point that you are a platform company, not just a hyperscaler. Maybe that's what it is all about, or maybe there's another story about you letting the other hyperscaler company coming from nowhere and claiming a big piece of that 4- to 5-year puzzle. And congratulations."
fa9d3f5cf6b2b4e5953e4d18206a81c9,28,Satya Nadella,"Well, thanks, Kash. I mean for us, again, just always goes back to, I think, the core principle, which is build a fleet that is fungible across the planet and works for third-party and first-party and research. So that's essentially what we have done. And so when some demand comes in shape, that don't fit that goal, where it's too concentrated, not just by customer, by location, by type of skewing, right? I think Amy mentioned some very key things. When you think about the margin profile of a hyperscaler, you've got to remember this, the AI accelerator piece, but there's compute, there's storage. And so if all of the demand just comes for just one [ meter ] that's really not a long-term business we want to be in. That's even from a third party. We have to balance it with all of our first-party stuff because that's after all a different margin stack for us. And then we have to fund our own R&D and model capability because in the long run, that's what's going to differentiate us. And so I look at all of those. We sort of use all of that to make sure we are saying yes to all the demand that we want, we say no to some of the demand that may be something that we could serve, but it's not in our long-term interest. And so that's sort of the decision-making we have done, and we feel very, very good about the decisions. In some sense, I feel even each time we say no to, the day after, I feel better."
fa9d3f5cf6b2b4e5953e4d18206a81c9,29,Amy Hood,"And just Kash, I think this is our last call with you. And I just want to say thanks and congratulations. It's been a privilege to work with you and best of luck."

486436,1,Operator,"Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Tesla's Fourth Quarter 2024 Q&A Webcast. My name is Travis Axelrod, the Head of Investor Relations here at Tesla, and I am joined today by Elon Musk and Vaibhav Taneja and a number of other executives. Our Q4 results were announced at about 3.00 p.m. Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue. Before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?"
486436,2,Elon Musk,"Thank you. So, in summary, in Q4, we set a record and delivered vehicles at an annualized rate of nearly 2 million a year. So, congratulations to the Tesla team on excellent work, achieving record production and deliveries. Model Y was the best-selling vehicle of any kind for 2024. That's worth noting. Not just the best electric vehicle, the best vehicle of any kind on earth, number one was Model Y. We're staying focused on maximizing volumes and obviously doubling down for, I don't know what, it really, I was going to say doubling down on autonomy, but really it's like autonomy is like 10x-ing. Frankly, doubling is not even enough. We made many critical investments in 2024 in manufacturing AI and robotics that will bear immense fruit in the future, immense. Like it's, in fact, to such a scale that it is difficult to comprehend. And I've said this before, and I'll stand by it. I see a path, I'm not saying it's an easy path, but I see a path for Tesla being the most valuable company in the world by far, not even close. Like, maybe several times more than, I mean, there is a path where Tesla is worth more than the next top five companies combined. There's a path to that. I mean, I think it's like an incredibly, just like a difficult path, but it is an achievable path. So -- and that is overwhelmingly due to autonomous vehicles and autonomous humanoid robots. So, our focus is actually building towards that. And that's where we're laying the ground. We laid the ground work for that in 2024. We'll continue to lay the ground work for that in 2025. In fact, more than laid the groundwork actually, so it would be building the structure, it’d be we're building the manufacturing lines and like -- like, setting up for what I think will be an epic 2026 and a ridiculous ‘27 and ‘28. Ridiculously good. That is my prediction. As yet, very few people understand the value of Full Self Driving and our ability to monetize the fleet. I've -- some of these things I've said for quite a long time and I know people said, well, Elon is the boy who cried wolf like several times but I'm telling you there's a damn wolf this time and you can drive it. In fact, it can drive you. It's a self-driving wolf. For a lot of people, like their experience of Tesla autonomy is like, if it's even a year old, if it's even two years old, it's like meeting someone when they're like a toddler and thinking that they're going to be a toddler forever. But obviously they're not going to be a toddler forever if they grow up. But if their last experience was like, FSD was a toddler, it's like, well, it's grown up now. Have you seen it? It's like walks and talks. And that's really what we've got. And it's difficult for people to understand this because human intuition is linear as opposed to what we're seeing is exponential progress. So, that's why my number one recommendation for anyone who doubts is simply try it. Have you tried it? When's the last time you tried it? And the only people who are skeptical, the only people who are skeptical are those who have not tried it. So, a car goes -- a passenger car typically has only about 10 hours of utility per week out of 168. A very small percentage. Once that car is autonomous, my rough estimate is that it is in use for at least a third of the hours of the week. So, call it 50, maybe 55 hours of the week. And it can be useful both for cargo delivery and people delivery. So, even let's say people are asleep, but you can deliver packages in the middle of the night or resupply restaurants or whatever the case may be, whatever people need at all hours of the day or night. That same asset, the thing that these things that already exist with no incremental cost change, just a software update, now have five times or more the utility than they currently have. I think this will be the largest asset value increase in human history. Maybe there's something bigger, but I just don't know what it is. And so people who look in the rearview mirror are looking for past precedent, except I don't think there is one. So -- but the reality of autonomy is upon us. And I repeat my advice, try driving the car or let it drive you. So, now it works very well in the US, but of course it will over time work just as well everywhere else. So, we're working hard to grow our annual volumes. Our constraint this year -- our current constraint is battery packs this year, but we're working on addressing that constraint. And I think we will make progress on addressing that constraint. And then things are really going to go ballistic next year, and really ballistic in ‘27 and ‘28. So, yeah. So, a bit more on Full Self Driving. Our Q4 Vehicle Safety Report shows continued year-over-year improvement in safety for vehicles so that the safety numbers, if somebody has supervised Full Self Driving turned on or not, the safety differences are gigantic. So, and people have seen the immense improvement with Version 13 and with incremental versions in Version 13 and then Version 14 is going to be yet another step beyond that that is very significant. We launched the Cortex training cluster at Gigafactory Austin, which was a significant contributor to FSD advancement, and we continue to invest in training infrastructure out of Texas headquarters. So, the training needs for Optimus or Optimus humanoid robot are probably at least ultimately 10x of what's needed for the car, at least to get to the full range of useful roles. You can say, how many different roles are there for a humanoid robot versus a car? Humanoid robot has probably, well, 1000 times more uses and more complex things than in a car. That doesn't mean the training scales by a 1000, but it's probably 10x. Now you can do this progressively. So it doesn't mean like, or Tesla is going to spend like $500 billion in training compute. Because we obviously train Optimus to do enough tasks to match the output of Optimus robots. And obviously, the cost of training is dropping dramatically with time. So, it is one of those things where I think long-term, Optimus will be -- Optimus has the potential to be north of $10 trillion in revenue. Like, it's really bananas. So that you can obviously afford a lot of training compute in that situation. In fact, even $500 billion training compute in that situation would be quite a good deal. Yeah. The future's going to be incredibly different from the past, that's for sure. We live at this unbelievable inflection point in human history. So, yeah. So, the proof is in the pudding. So, we're going to be launching unsupervised Full Self Driving as a paid service in Austin in June. So -- and I've talked with the team. We feel confident in being able to do an initial launch of unsupervised, no one in the car, Full Self Driving in Austin in June. We already have Tesla's operating autonomously unsupervised Full Self Driving at our factory in Fremont and we’ll soon be doing that at our factory in Texas. So, thousands of cars every day are driving with no one in them at our Fremont factory in California. They will soon be doing that in Austin and then elsewhere in the world for the rest of our factories which is pretty cool. And the cars aren't just driving to exactly the same spot because obviously it all, [went and collide] (ph) at the same spot. The cars are actually programmed with what lane they need to park in to be picked up for delivery. So, they drive from the factory end of line to their specific - to their destination parking spot and then could be picked up for delivery to customers and then doing this reliably every day, thousands of times a day. It's pretty cool. Like I said, the Teslas will be in the wild with no one in them, in June in Austin. So, what I'm saying is this is not some far-off mythical situation. It's literally, five, six months away, five months away kind of thing. And while we're stepping into -- putting our toe in the water gently at first, just to make sure everything's cool, our solution is a generalized AI solution. It does not require high precision maps of a locality. So we just want to be cautious. It's not that it doesn't work beyond Austin. In fact, it does. We just want to be, put a toe in the water, make sure everything is okay, then put a few more toes in the water, then put a foot in the water with safety of the general public and those in the car as our top priority. With regard to Optimus, obviously I'm making these revenue predictions that sound absolutely insane. I realize that. But they are, I think, they will prove to be accurate. Yeah. Now, with Optimus, there's a lot of uncertainty on the exact timing, because it's not like a train arriving at the station for Optimus. We are designing the train and the station and in real time while also building the tracks. And so they're like, people shouldn’t say like, why didn't the train arrive exactly at 12:05? We're literally designing the train and the track and the station in real time while you're saying, how can we predict this thing with absolute precision? It's impossible. The normal internal plan calls for roughly 10,000 Optimus robots to be built this year. Will we succeed in building 10,000 exactly by the end of December this year? Probably not, but will we succeed in making several thousand? Yes, I think we will. Will those several thousand Optimus robots be doing useful things by the end of year? Yes, I'm confident they will do useful things. The Optimus in use at the Tesla factories, production design one, will inform how - what we change for production design two, which we expect to launch next year. And our goal is to ramp prompt Optimus production faster than maybe anything's ever been ramped. Meaning, like aspirationally an order of magnitude ramp per year. Now, if we aspire to an order of magnitude ramp per year, perhaps we only end up with a half order of magnitude per year. But that's the kind of growth that we're talking about. It doesn't take very many years before we're making 100 million of these things a year. If you go up by, let's say, a factor, by 5x per year, insane. Not 50%, 500%. So, these are big growth numbers. Yeah. But we do need to be -- this is an entirely new supply chain, is entirely new technology. There's nothing off the shelf to use. We try desperately with Optimus to use any existing motors, any actuators, sensors, nothing worked for our humanoid robot, at any price. We had to design everything from physics first principles to work for a humanoid robot and with the most sophisticated hand that has ever been made before, by far. And Optimus will be able to like play the piano and be able to thread a needle. I mean this is the level of precision no one has been able to achieve. And so it's really something special. So, yeah, so -- and my prediction long term is that Optimus will be overwhelmingly the value of the company. Regarding energy, back to Earth. Mr. Elon, can you come back here for a minute? Okay, back to Earth. Energy storage is a big deal and will become, it's already super important, will become incredibly important in the future. And it is something that enables far greater energy output to the grid than is currently possible. Because the grid, the grids are -- the vast majority of the grid has no energy storage capability. So, they have to design the power plants to, for very high peaks and assuming that there's no energy storage. Once you have grid energy storage and home-based energy storage, the actual total energy output per year of the grid is dramatically greater than people think. Maybe it's at least double. This will drive the demand of stationary battery packs, and especially the grid scale ones, to insane, basically as much demand as we could possibly make. So, we have our second factory, which is in Shanghai, that's starting operation and we're building a third factory. So we're trying to ramp output of the stationary battery storage as quickly as possible. Now, there is a challenge here where we have to be careful to that we're not robbing from one pocket to take to another pocket because for a given gigawatt hours per year of the cell output, we have to say, does it go into stationary applications or mobile applications? It can't go both into both. So, we have to make that trade-off. Yeah. But overall, the demand for total gigawatt hours of batteries, whether mobile or stationary, that will grow in a very, very big way over time. So, in conclusion, 2025 really is a pivotal year for Tesla. And when we look back on 2025 and the launch of unsupervised Full Self Driving, true real-world AI that actually works, I think they may regard it as the biggest year in Tesla history, maybe even bigger than our first car, the Roadster or the Model S, so the Model 3 or Model Y. In fact, I think it probably will be viewed ‘25 as maybe the most important year in Tesla's history. There is no company in the world that is as good at real-world AI as Tesla. I don't even know who’s in second place. Like, you say like who's in second place for real-world AI. I would need a very big telescope to see them. That's how far behind they are. All right."
486436,3,Travis Axelrod,"Great. Thank you very much, Elon. And, Vaibhav has some opening remarks as well."
486436,4,Vaibhav Taneja,"Yeah, I'll talk about things on Earth. As Elon mentioned, in Q4, we set records in vehicle deliveries and energy storage deployments in an uncertain macro environment. We were able to grow auto and energy storage volumes both sequentially and on a year-on-year basis. For this, I would like to thank the efforts of everyone at Tesla to make this a reality and our customers who helped us achieve this feat. Coming into the fourth quarter, our focus was to reduce inventory levels in the automotive business and we accomplished that by ending the quarter with the lowest finished good inventory in the last two years. This was a result of offering not only attractive financing options but also other discounts and programs which impacted ASPs. While we saw volume growth in almost all regions that we operate in, we hit a new record for deliveries in the Greater China market. This is an encouraging trend since we grew volume in a highly competitive BEV market. On the automotive margin front, we saw a quarter-over-quarter decline primarily due to lower ASPs and due to the recognition of FSD related revenue in Q3 from feature releases. Our journey on cost reduction continues, and we were able to get our overall cost per car down below $35,000, primarily by material costs. This was despite increased depreciation and other costs as we prepare for the transition to the new Model Y for which we recently started taking orders in all markets. All our factories will start producing the new Model Y next month while we feel confident in our team’s abilities to ramp production quickly, know that it is an unprecedented change and we are not aware of anybody else taking the best-selling car on the planet and updating all factories at the same time. This changeover will result in several weeks of lost production in the quarter. As a result, margins will be impacted due to idle capacity and other ramp related costs, as is common in any launch, but will be overcome as production is ramped. We will be introducing several new products throughout 2025. We are still on track to launch a more affordable model in the first half of 2025 and will continue to expand our lineup from there. From a dollar-for-dollar basis, we believe we have the most compelling lineup today compared to the industry, and it will continue to get better from here. As always, all our products come with the best software in the industry, autonomy features and capable of full autonomy in the future. And despite the premium experience, the total cost of ownership is close to mass market, less premium competitors. Energy storage deployments reached an all-time high in Q4, and this -- and resulted in -- but declined sequentially. This was a result of higher -- sorry, growth came from Megapack and Powerwall. Both businesses continue to be supply constrained, and like Elon mentioned, we're trying to ramp up production with Megafactory Shanghai coming online this quarter onwards. While quarterly deployments will likely continue to fluctuate sequentially, we expect at least 50% growth in deployments year-over-year in 2025. Gross profit and margins in the service and other business was up year-over-year but declined sequentially. This was the result of higher service center costs and lower profit from used car business. The businesses within service and other primarily support our new car business, especially through their impact on total cost of ownership. Therefore, while we manage them to be positive on a GAAP basis, we do not expect similar margins as the rest of the business. There's a lot of uncertainty around tariffs. Over the years, we've tried to localize our supply chain in every market, but we are still very reliant on parts from across the world for all our businesses. Therefore, the imposition of tariffs, which is very likely, and any [Indiscernible] will have an impact on our business and profitability. Our operating expenses grew both year-over-year and sequentially. The biggest driver of the increase was R&D as we continue to invest in AI-related initiatives. The remaining increase came from growth in our sales capabilities and marketing efforts from referral program. For 2025, we expect operating expenses to increase to support our growth initiatives. It is important to point out that the net income in Q4 was impacted by a $600 million mark-to-market benefit from Bitcoin due to the adoption of a new accounting standard for digital assets, whereby we will change -- we will take mark-to-market adjustments through other income every reporting period going forward. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $2 billion, and despite CapEx increase of over $2.4 billion in 2024, we were able to generate free cash flow of $3.6 billion for the year. CapEx efficiency is something we are extremely focused on. While we have invested in AI-related initiatives, we have done so in a very targeted manner to utilize the spend to get immediate benefits. The build-out of Cortex was accelerated because of the role -- actually to accelerate the rollout of FSD Version 13. Accumulative AI-related CapEx, including infrastructure, so far has been approximately $5 billion. And for 2025, we expect our CapEx to be flat on a year-over-year basis. In conclusion, like Elon said, 2025 is going to be a pivotal year for Tesla. There are a lot of investments which we have made and will continue to make in this coming year, which will set the pace for the next phase of growth. And it is something which now I'm getting out of earth, it is going to be out of this world. And we just are putting the right foundation. And that's all I have."
486436,5,Travis Axelrod,"Great. Thank you very much, Vaibhav. Now, we will move over to investor questions and we'll start with say.com. The first question is, is unsupervised FSD still planned to be released in Texas and California this year? What hurdles still exist to make that happen? You addressed the Texas piece, I think, already, so..."
486436,6,Elon Musk,"Yeah, I'm confident that we'll release unsupervised FSD in California this year as well. Yeah, in fact, I think we will most likely release unsupervised FSD in many regions of the country of the US by the end of this year. Like I said, we're just putting our toe in the water, then a few toes, then a foot, then leg, then make sure everything is cool. And we're looking for a safety level that is significantly above the average human driver. So, it's not anywhere like much safer, not like a little bit safer than human, way safer than human. So the standard has to be very high because the moment there's any kind of accident with an autonomous car, this immediately gets worldwide headlines, even though about 40,000 people die every year in car accidents in the US, and most of them don't even get a mention anywhere. But if somebody scrapes a shin with an autonomous car, it's headline news."
486436,7,Vaibhav Taneja,We want to avoid that.
486436,8,Elon Musk,"Yeah. So it's really from an -- the only thing holding us back is an excess of caution. But people can certainly get a feel for how well the car would perform as unsupervised FSD by simply having a car, allowing the car to drive you around your city and see how many times did you have to intervene. Not where you wanted to intervene or were a little concerned. But how many times did you have to intervene for, for definite safety reasons. And you will find that that is currently very rare, and over time, almost never."
486436,9,Travis Axelrod,"Great. Thank you very much. The next question is, are there any discussions with other auto companies about licensing FSD?"
486436,10,Elon Musk,"Yes. What we're seeing is, at this point, significant interest from a number of major car companies about licensing for Tesla Full Soft Driving technology. What we've generally said is the best way to know what to do is take one of our cars apart, and then you can see where the placement of the cameras are, what the thermal needs are of the Tesla AI inference computer. That's better than us sending some CAD drawings. And then we're only going to entertain situations where the volume would be very high, otherwise it's not worth the complexity. And we will not burden our engineering team with laborious discussions with other engineering teams until we obviously have unsupervised Full Self Driving working throughout the United States. I think the interest level from other manufacturers to license an FSD will be extremely high once it is obvious that unless you have FSD, you're dead."
486436,11,Travis Axelrod,"Great. Thank you very much. The next question is, is Optimus now mostly design locked for 2025 production?"
486436,12,Elon Musk,"Optimus is not design locked. So, when I say like we're designing the train as it's going to -- we're redesigning the train as it’s going down the tracks while redesigning the tracks and the train stations."
486436,13,Vaibhav Taneja,Every [indiscernible].
486436,14,Elon Musk,"Yeah, it's rapidly evolving. It's rapidly evolving in a good direction. It's pretty damn amazing actually. Team’s doing a fantastic job. We really have, by far, I think by far the best team of humanoid robotics engineers in the world. And we also have all the other ingredients necessary, because you need a great battery pack, you need great power electronics, you need great charging capability, you need great communications, great Wi-Fi and cellular connectivity. And of course, you need real-world AI. And then the ability to scale that production to huge levels. So you have to design for manufacturing. The things that, really what other companies are missing is they're missing the real-world AI and they're missing the ability to scale manufacturing to millions of units a year."
486436,15,Vaibhav Taneja,I think that is an underappreciated thing that industrialization of design is a whole different thing than making a design.
486436,16,Elon Musk,"Yeah, prototypes are trivial basically. Prototypes are easy, production is hard. I've said that for many years. The problem is that there's like, those who have never been involved in production or manufacturing somehow think that once you come up with some eureka design that you magically can make a million units a year. And this is totally false. There needs to be some Hollywood story where they show actually the problem is manufacturing. I've never even heard of one. It just doesn't fit the narrative. The Hollywood thing is like it's like some lone inventor in a garage goes Eureka and suddenly it files a patent and suddenly there's millions of units. I, like, I'm listening to guys who were missing most really 99% of the story. 1% is another old saying of one person -- like a product is 1% inspiration 99% perspiration. The Hollywood shows you 1% inspiration and minus, but forgets about the 99% perspiration of actually figuring out how to make that initial prototype manufacturable and then manufactured at high volume such that the product is reliable, low cost, consistent, doesn't break down all the time, and that is 100 times harder, at least, than the prototype."
486436,17,Vaibhav Taneja,"Then you have to get it there, deliver it, I think, yeah."
486436,18,Elon Musk,"Yeah, you have to meet all these regulations, and there's a million regulators around the world, it's pretty difficult."
486436,19,Travis Axelrod,"Great, thank you. The next question is also Optimus related. When will Tesla start selling Optimus, and what will the price be?"
486436,20,Elon Musk,"Well, the -- it may -- for this year we expect to just close the loop with Optimus being used internally at Tesla, because we obviously can easily use several thousand humanoid robots at Tesla for the most boring, annoying tasks in the factory, like the tasks nobody wants to do, where we have to like beg people to do this task. And then they -- then it's like the robot's totally happy to do the boring, dangerous, repetitive task that no humans want to do. And that's also actually some of the easiest use cases for us to have Optimus do things like load the hopper, like, say you're loading the body line if you're transporting pieces of sheet metal to the robot, which is already robot, the robot welding line for the body, and you just have to nonstop take things out of a, from one fixture to another fixture. And it's a very boring job That's the kind of thing what the Optimus could do."
486436,21,Vaibhav Taneja,The guy who runs around all the wall studs and the pins.
486436,22,Elon Musk,"Yeah, there's a ton of boring jobs, tedious jobs, dangerous, slightly dangerous jobs that are perfect for Optimus. So we expect to use Optimus for those tasks at our factories and that'll help us close loop for improvement this year. It really was the production Version 2 which I think launches sometime next year. I'd like it to be the beginning of next year but maybe it's more like the middle of next year. And then we have to -- with a production line that is designed for -- on the order of 10,000 units a month versus 1,000 units a month. So, when you're designing a production line for 1,000 units a month, it takes you a while to actually reach anywhere close to 1,000 units a month. For any given production output, it takes a while to actually reach its potential. The current line that we're designing is for roughly 1,000 units a month of Optimus robots. The next line would be for 10,000 units a month. The line after that would be for 100,000 units a month. And I think probably with Version 2, it is a very rough guess because there's so much uncertainty here, very rough guess that we start delivering Optimus robots to companies that are outside of Tesla in maybe the second half of next year, something like that. But like I said, this is such an exponential ramp that it will go from no one's receiving humanoid robots to these things like coming out like crazy."
486436,23,Vaibhav Taneja,We can't build enough.
486436,24,Elon Musk,"We're always going to be in a we can't build enough situation. Demand will not be a problem even at a high price. And then as I said, like, once we start -- once we're at a steady state of above 1 million units a year, I think the production -- I'm confident at 1 million units a year, that the production cost of Optimus will be less than $20,000. If you compare the complexity of Optimus to the complexity of a car, so just the total mass and complexity of Optimus is much less than a car. So, I would expect that at similar volumes to say the Model Y, which is over 1 million units a year, that you'd see Optimus be, I don't know, half the cost or something like that. What the price of Optimus is a different matter. The price of Optimus will be set by the market demand."
486436,25,Travis Axelrod,"Great. Thank you very much. The next question is, what is the status on mass production of the Tesla Semi? And how will it impact revenue and scale?"
486436,26,Lars Moravy,"I can take that one. So, we just closed out the Semi factory roof of walls last week in Reno, a schedule, which is great with the weather. In Reno, you never know what's going to happen. But we're prepping for mechanical installation of all the equipment in the coming months. The first builds of the high volume Semi design come late this year in 2025 and begin ramping early in 2026. But as we've said before, the Semi is a TCO, no-brainer. I think it's really similar to Optimus, set by how much people pay and it has the total cost of ownership, it's much, much cheaper than any other transportation you can have. So at that point, when we're at scale, it will meaningfully contribute to Tesla's revenue. I think it’s difficult to say how much. Anything you want to add Elon?"
486436,27,Elon Musk,"No. I mean, I do think that Tesla Semi, again with autonomy, is going to be incredibly valuable. That we actually have a shortage of truck drivers in America, that's one of the limiting factors on transport. And people are human so they get tired and sometimes there's -- it's -- I have a lot of respect for truck drivers because it's a tough job. But because it's a tough job, there's not that many people that want to do it. And there's actually fewer -- I believe, if my saying is correct, there are a few people entering truck driving as a profession than are not leaving it."
486436,28,Vaibhav Taneja,Yes.
486436,29,Elon Musk,"So when you think, yeah, exactly. So when you consider, okay, there's more people leaving truck driving as a profession than entering it, well, we're going to have a real logistics problem as time goes by. So autonomy will be very important to meet that need. So like, yeah, it will -- I don't know. It's a several billion a year opportunity, which I don't know in this context. Is that -- these days, does several billion a year matter? I think it does. It's not nothing. It's probably -- it might -- it’s probably like a $10 billion a year thing. That's $1 billion a month at some point probably. But it's -- all this is going to pale in comparison to Optimus. So yeah, $1 billion a month is a lot but it's not -- it's going to be like 1% of Optimus."
486436,30,Travis Axelrod,"Great. Thank you very much. We already covered the next question in opening remarks, so moving on. Is it expected that Tesla that will need to upgrade Hardware 3 vehicles? And if so, what is the timeline and expected impact to Tesla's CapEx? I think they are referring to cost there."
486436,31,Elon Musk,"They're really asking the tough questions, aren't they?"
486436,32,Vaibhav Taneja,"I guess we reached -- we haven't started working on Hardware 3 yet. We are still making software releases. We released the 12.6 release recently, which was like a -- is like a baby V13, but it's a significant improvement compared to what they had previously. And people are still finding ways, there are still larger motors in the smaller models. So we don't give up on Hardware 3, we're still working on it. Just the releases will trail the Hardware 4 releases."
486436,33,Travis Axelrod,Great. Thanks.
486436,34,Elon Musk,"Yeah. I mean, I think the honest answer is that we're going to have to upgrade people's Hardware 3 computer for those that have bought Full Self Driving, and that is the honest answer and that's going to be painful and difficult but we'll get it done. Now, I'm kind of glad that not that many people bought the FSD package."
486436,35,Travis Axelrod,"Thanks, Elon. The next question. Has Tesla given up on ramping their solar roof product?"
486436,36,Elon Musk,"No, we -- sorry, Mike, go ahead, yeah."
486436,37,Unidentified Company Representative,"Yes, I can take it. Yeah, solar roof is a core part of the residential product portfolio and it still remains. It draws a lot of customer interest despite it being premium products. We've worked on multiple iterations of engineering to make the product easier to install and distribute by reducing SKU count. And more recently, rather than direct installation, we are focused on growth through our nationwide network of certified installers. And many of those, they've been installing solar roof for many years."
486436,38,Elon Musk,"That's actually turned out to be a much better way for the -- like it's just let the roof -- just supply products to the roofing industry. And especially when somebody's is getting a new roof anyway or building a house from scratch, obviously, this is by far the most efficient time to put in a solar roof as opposed to putting a solar roof on a house that -- where the roof still has 20 years of life. That's not economically senseful. But if it's a new house or the roof needs to be replaced anyway, then solar roof can make a lot of sense. And it is a premium product. It's like the Model S, Model X or something, like it's a premium product. I think it looks really cool. And you -- I mean, your house generates electricity. And if you combine it with the Tesla Powerwall battery, then you can be self-sufficient. So, even if the grid turns off, even if the grid turns off for several days, your house still works, and your roof looks awesome. So, it's like, I recommend anyone who had -- who can afford it, get the Tesla solar roof and the Powerwall. Your family’s life might depend on it. And just in terms of convenience, your kids are not going to yell at you because their computers don't work because power went out and you can't charge your phone. Actually happens. Yeah. You literally can't even call anyone because your phones out of juice."
486436,39,Travis Axelrod,"Thank you very much. The next question was covered in opening remarks, so we will skip that. And the last question from say.com. What technical breakthroughs will define V14 of FSD, given that V13 already covered photon to control?"
486436,40,Elon Musk,"Well, we're going to help a lot -- help a lot further than [indiscernible] We've been in sort of the nothing but nets situation, nothing but neural nets from photons to controls for a while now for just improving the neural nets. I guess we could get into some of the technical details to some degree. I have to say I continue to be amazed by just how effective order aggressive transformers are at solving a wide range of problems. I mean, Ashok, is there anything you'd like to add there without giving away the sort of family secrets?"
486436,41,Ashok Elluswamy,"I mean, except for things we put on X already. Yeah, it's continuing to scale the model size a lot. We scale a bunch in V13, but then there's still room to grow. So we're going to continue to scale the model size. We're going to increase the context length even more. The memory is sort of limited right now. We want to increase the amount of memory, also give to even minutes of context for driving. We're going to add audio and emergency vehicles better, add data of the tricky common cases that we get from the entire fleet, any interventions or any kind of user intervention. We just add that to the data, the dataset. So the scaling in basically every axis, training compute, data set size, model size, model context, and also all the reinforcement learning objectives."
486436,42,Travis Axelrod,"Great. Alrighty. With that, we will move over to analyst questions. So just as a reminder, you will need to unmute yourself to ask your question and the first question will be coming from Daniel Roeska from Bernstein. Daniel, please go ahead and unmute yourself."
486436,43,Daniel Roeska,"Hey, good evening, everybody. It's Daniel from Bernstein. Elon, Tesla's share price clearly already includes quite few of the anticipated benefits you talked about today, yet realizing what you call kind of difficult but achievable will take some time. What are you pushing the Tesla executive team to do differently now to accelerate the innovation in order to realize the value you described for the company."
486436,44,Elon Musk,"Well, I mean, we're, I think, working on perfecting real-world AI and making rapid progress week over week, if not month, certainly month over month, but often week over week. I spent a lot of time with the Tesla AI team and the Tesla Optimus team. I mean, I go where the problem is essentially. Like, not -- if something's, this is, unfortunately sometimes, like, don't talk to Tesla executives, and like, hey, we don't see you very often. I'm like, that's because your stuff is working awesome. If you start working really great, unfortunately, I didn't see them very often because I go where the problem is. So, [indiscernible] what's the greatest challenge that lies ahead? So obviously there are many challenges with Optimus. It's a hard problem to solve. Many challenges with vehicle autonomy. But we're making rapid progress in both. Yeah."
486436,45,Daniel Roeska,"Okay. I mean, it sounds like you've got a conviction that the pieces you need, right, are in place. If we kind of go 12 months down the line and we look back, and you had some of those, but maybe what are the kind of two or three KPIs that would tell you that you're on track and it's going the right way and the pieces you've put in place are the right pieces, right? That's kind of what I'm looking for or other way around, where would it be off most likely in your mind that you say, hey, I need to go back there and I need to change something to enable the team better?"
486436,46,Elon Musk,"Well, I mean, I think my predictions that I'm making here are going to be pretty accurate. And it's worth the next -- sometimes people say, Elon's always late. Well, actually, no, the problem is that the media reports on when I'm late, but never reports when I'm early. So sure, I'm optimistic, but I'm not that optimistic. There are many cases in the past where I actually, we've been early, such as completion of the Shanghai factory or factory completion has generally have been ahead of schedule, not behind. So, yeah, so the -- but I like to say I'm very confident we'll have released unsupervised Full Self Driving fully autonomous Teslas in Austin and several other cities in America by the end of this year. That's probably everywhere in America next year, and everywhere in North America at least. I think in terms of next year our constraints, I think it's likely to be just regulatory. Like Europe really has, for example, Europe is a layer cake of regulations and bureaucracy, which really needs to be addressed. There's this joke like America innovates, Europe regulates. It's like, guys, there's too many refs on the field. I mean, for example, for us to just to release supervised Full Self Driving in Europe, even though it works really well, we have to go through a mountain of paperwork with the Netherlands, which is our primary regulatory authority. Then the Netherlands presents this to the EU and I think May. And there's like this big EU country committee. We expect it to be approved at that time, but there's nothing we can do to make that may happen sooner. In fact, nobody seems to do it. But I guess all the countries would have to somehow vote in some way to have it happen sooner than May. Otherwise, it won't happen sooner than May. So then when is unsupervised FSD allowed in Europe? I’m like, May next year maybe? I don't know. I have to find out when the EU is meeting again. Sometimes it's a 12-month cadence, sometimes a six-month cadence. Then in China, which is a gigantic market, we do have some challenges because they weren't, currently allow us to transfer training video outside of China. And then the US government wouldn't let us do training in China. So we're in a bit of a bind there. So like, bit of a quandary. So we are already solving then is by literally looking at videos of streets in China that are available on the Internet to understand and then feeding that into our video training so that publicly available video of street signs and traffic rules in China can be used for training and then also putting it in a very accurate simulator. And so it will train using SIM for bus lanes in China. Like bus lanes in China, by the way, were about the biggest challenges in making FSD work in China is the bus lanes are very complicated. And there's like literally like hours of the day that you're allowed to be there and not be there. And then if you accidentally go in that bus lane at the wrong time, you get an automatic ticket instantly. So, it's kind of a big deal, bus lanes in China. So we're going to put that into our simulator, train on that. The car has to know what time of day it is, read the sign. Anyway, we'll get this solved. But I think we'll have unsupervised FSD in almost every market this year limited simply by regulatory issues, not technical capability. And then unsupervised FSD in the US this year, in many cities, but nationwide next year. And hopefully we have unsupervised FSD in most countries by the end of next year. That's my prediction with the best data that I have right now."
486436,47,Travis Axelrod,"Great. Thank you very much. The next question will come from Adam Jonas at Morgan Stanley. Adam, please feel free to unmute yourself."
486436,48,Adam Jonas,"Thanks everybody. So, Elon, you've said in the past about LiDAR, for AVs at least, that LiDAR is a crutch, a fool's errand. I think you even told me once, even if it was free, you'd say you wouldn't use it. Do you still feel that way?"
486436,49,Elon Musk,Yes.
486436,50,Adam Jonas,"Care to elaborate or just, I have another question."
486436,51,Elon Musk,"Look, we even have a radar in the car and we turned it off."
486436,52,Adam Jonas,I got it. All right. So you're still -- people think you're crazy for not looking to LiDAR.
486436,53,Elon Musk,"Obviously humans drive without shooting lasers out of their eyes. Unless you're Superman. But like humans drive just with passive visual, humans drive with eyes and a neural net and a brain neural net. So the digital equivalent of eyes and a brain are cameras and digital neural nets or AI. So that's the entire road system was designed for passive optical neural nets. That's how the whole road system was not designed and what everyone's expecting, that's how we expect other cars to behave. So therefore that is very obviously the solution for Full Self Driving in it as a generalized, but the generalized solution for Full Self Driving as opposed to the very specific, neighborhood by neighborhood solution, which is very difficult to maintain, which is what our competitors are doing."
486436,54,Adam Jonas,I got it.
486436,55,Elon Musk,"Yeah. I mean, LiDAR doesn't work in the fall, guys. LiDAR has a lot of issues. I don't have to like, the SpaceX Dragon docks with the space station using LiDAR that a program that I've personally spearheaded. I don't have some fundamental bizarre dislike of LiDAR. It's simply the wrong solution for driving cars on roads."
486436,56,Adam Jonas,Right. You understand how light are works. I get it.
486436,57,Elon Musk,"Literally designed and built our own red LiDAR. I oversaw the project, the engineering thing. It was my decision to use LiDAR on Dragon and I oversaw the engineering project directly. So I'm like we literally designed and made a radar, a LiDAR to dock with the space station. But if I thought it was the right solution for cars, I would do that, but it isn't."
486436,58,Adam Jonas,"Yeah. All right. Just as a follow up. At CES, you said, I'm paraphrasing, that any AI will be able to do any cognitive task not involving atoms within the next three or four years. And that would imply, Elon, that before the end of President Trump's term in office, that AI would be moving pretty damn quickly into the physical world, into the world of photons and atoms. And I'm thinking, given your work with the administration, how confident are you that the US will have the manufacturing and the supply base to make good on your excitement about physical AI by the end of -- by latter this decade. We seem pretty vulnerable right now. I've seen you tweeting about, or sorry, X-ing, excuse me, Elon, about China, Freudian slip, about China having like making more drones in a day than the US makes in a year and all the entanglement of the supply. So, what has to happen in the US to make that possible? What's your message and what can what can you do about it and what's relevant for Tesla shareholders? Thanks, Elon."
486436,59,Elon Musk,"Well, at Tesla, obviously, we think manufacturing is cool. SpaceX, we think manufacturing is cool. But in general, for talented Americans, they need to be beyond, beyond my companies, beyond me and my teams here, in general, we need to make manufacturing cool again in America. And, like, I honestly think people should move from like law and finance into manufacturing. That's my honest opinion. We have too much, this is both a compliment and a criticism. We have too much talent in law and finance in America. And there should be more of that talent in manufacturing. So, yeah. The potential for the future. I mean, it tells that we're making sure that we can continue to manufacture our stuff. Even in the event of geopolitical tensions rising to very high levels."
486436,60,Adam Jonas,"Great. Thank you very much. The next question will come from Pierre Ferragu at New Street. Pierre, please feel free to unmute yourself."
486436,61,Pierre Ferragu,"Hey, thanks guys for taking the question. So, I have a question on deploying like robotaxis in June in Austin. So that's great news. And I was wondering if it means I can drive down to Austin in June and try unsupervised by myself with my car, or it's going to be more like your fleet testing it?"
486436,62,Elon Musk,"It'll be our fleet testing it. That's our sort of toe in the water. We'll be scrutinizing it very carefully, make sure it's not something we missed. But it will be, autonomous ride-hailing for money in Austin in June. And then as shortly as possible other cities in America. And I expect us to be operating, doing unsupervised activity with our internal fleet in several cities by the end of the year. Then it's probably next year when people are able to add or subtract their car from the fleet. So, kind of like Airbnb where you can sort of add or subtract your house or your guest room, you can say like add it to the Airbnb inventory or don't add it to the Airbnb inventory. If you're traveling for a month, or whatever, in case maybe you can, that other people use your house. Anyway, that's probably next year because we want to just make sure we've ironed out any kinks. And a lot of it is, it's not like we're not splitting the atom here. It's just a bunch of work that needs to be done to make sure the whole thing works efficiently, that people can order the car. It comes, it's the right spot, does exactly the right thing. All the payment systems work. The billing works."
486436,63,Pierre Ferragu,"Yeah. Okay. But then, like, so my follow-up question would be, I have a Tesla, I have a FSD, and I have to keep my eyes on the road all the time. It's super boring because I don't really need to intervene anymore. And the really annoying thing is that I can't just check my emails. And so are you working also on introducing, like a kind of like free and supervised where I could be eyes off and I would be able to check my email and we just need to, with a five second notice, have to go back and keep an eye on what's happening or is that something you're working on as well? Because it feels so close with this certain that I wonder if it's something you'd expect for this year. It's a very sensitive question. I asked for myself to be honest."
486436,64,Elon Musk,"Yes, we just need -- we need to be very confident that the probability of injury is low before we allow people to check with their email and text messages. In fact, right now we're in this perverse situation, which you may have encountered yourself where people will actually go to manual driving to check their text messages so the computer doesn't yell at them and then go then put it back on autonomous mode once they have checked the text messages, which is obviously less safe, significantly less safe, significantly less safe than just letting people check their text once in a while without the computer yelling at them. But we just want to be cautious about the advent that we're in this sort of, neither here nor there, but just for, I mean, I think it's not for many months longer. But yeah, we're in this perverse situation where people will turn the car off autopilot so the computer doesn't yell at them, check the text messages while steering the car with their knee and not looking out the window."
486436,65,Ashok Elluswamy,"And like Elon said, if you have any problems with the system and when people are not looking, that is a dangerous thing. And that's what we're trying to avoid. The capability is getting there, but it's not fully there. That's why he was using the term of tipping a toe in the water, then getting comfortable, then keeping going."
486436,66,Elon Musk,"Yeah. Anyway, it's not far off. But we would not want to prove to ourselves and also prove to regulators that the car is unequivocally safer in autonomous mode than not. And that's, we're not far off. So, this is like low single-digit months."
486436,67,Ashok Elluswamy,"To the safety aspect, we did publish our Vehicle Safety Report today. And then Q4 is one crash for every 5.9 million miles driven compared to a crash every 700,000 miles without…"
486436,68,Elon Musk,We're getting to the point where it's an order of magnitude.
486436,69,Ashok Elluswamy,"Yeah, it's like 8.5 times safer. So it's just about there. It's amazing."
486436,70,Travis Axelrod,"Great. Alrighty. And our last question will be coming from Dan Levy at Barclays. Dan, feel free to unmute yourself."
486436,71,Dan Levy,"Great. Good evening. Thank you for taking other questions. Elon, you've talked about the need for proliferation of sustainable transport in the past as part of sort of broader push to sustainable energy. Look, I know we've heard a lot about President Trump's plans to reverse the EV Mandate and I think there's a view that given regulation is a driver of EV uptake, this could slow EV uptake in the US. So, what would be your view on the right policy in the US, given your comments in the past of the need to push for sustainable transport?"
486436,72,Elon Musk,"At this point, I think that sustainable transport is inevitable. I'm highly confident that all transport will be autonomous electric, including aircraft, and that it simply, it can't be stopped any more than one could have stopped the advent of the external combustion engine, steam engine, or one could have stopped the advent of the internal combustion engine. Like, even if you've been the biggest [indiscerinble] advocate on earth, like courses of the way, not these newfangled car automobiles, you can't stop the advent of automobile. It's going to happen. And you can't stop the advent of electric cars. It's going to happen. The only thing holding back electric cars was range, and that is the sole problem."
486436,73,Dan Levy,"Great. And then as a follow up, in the past, Elon, you had made a comment that, you'd be willing to sell cars at effectively no margin to get the cars out there. And there's a comment in the release today of the rate of acceleration of autonomy efforts does impact volume growth. So perhaps you could just talk about, with your efforts on FSD, how we should think about your desire to put more vehicles out in the market to take advantage of your tech advances."
486436,74,Elon Musk,"So, I'm not sure I understand the question. We have a lot of cars. I mean, we've got millions of cars out there."
486436,75,Vaibhav Taneja,"So, is your question, Dan, that how do we marry our future growth aspects with FSD?"
486436,76,Travis Axelrod,"Go ahead and unmute yourself, Dan."
486436,77,Dan Levy,Yeah. More so just how much more aggressively you would be willing to sell your cars versus in light of your improvements on FSD.
486436,78,Elon Musk,"Well, right now, the constraint we're trying to solve is battery production as opposed to demand. So, there are -- now Q1, we've got this massive factory retooling for the new Model Y, for example. That obviously has a short-term impact on output. But the problem we are seeing with, in fact, we're talking that the executive team and I were talking about just before this call was we've got to figure out how to increase total gigawatt hours of battery production this year one way or another. That's the constraint on our output."
486436,79,Travis Axelrod,"Great. Alrighty. And with that, I think we are all done for today. So, thanks, everyone, so much for all your questions. We look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you very much, and goodbye."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,1,AI Insights,
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,2,Operator,"Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's First Quarter 2025 Q&A Webcast. My name is Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Vaibhav Taneja, and a number of other executives. Our Q1 results were announced at about 3 p.m. Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue. Before we jump into Q&A, Elon will be providing an update. Elon?"
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,3,Elon Musk,"Hello, everyone. Well, there’s never a dull moment these days. Thanks for sure. Every day is going to be exciting. As some people know, there's been some blowback for the time that I've been spending in government with the Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE. I think the work that we're doing there is actually very important for trying to sprain in the insane deficit that is leading our country, the United States, to destruction. And the DOGE team has made a lot of progress in addressing waste and fraud. The natural blowback from that is those who were receiving the wasteful dollars and the fortunate dollars will try to attack me and DOGE team and anything associated with me. So, but then I'm really left with two choices. Should we just let the waste and fraud continue? And it was continuing at a -- to grow at a really unsustainable pace that was bankrupting the country or to fight the waste and fraud and try to get the country back on the right track. And I believe the right thing to do is to just fight the waste and fraud and get the country back on the right track and working together with President Trump and his administration. Because if the ship of America goes down, we all go down with it, including Tesla and everyone else. So, I think this is critical work. Now, the protests that you'll see out there, they're very organized, they're paid for. They're obviously not going to say, admit that the reason that they're protesting is because they're receiving fraudulent money or that they are the recipients of wasteful largesse, but they're going to come up with some other reason. But that is - the real reason for the protests, the actual reason is that those receiving the waste and fraud wish to continue receiving it. That is the real thing that's going on here, obviously. So, now that said, I do think there's the large slug of work necessary to get the DOGE team in place and working in the government to get the financial house in order is mostly done. And I think starting probably next month, May, my time allocation to DOGE will drop significantly. I'll have to continue doing it for, I think, probably the remainder of the President's term, just to make sure that the waste and fraud that we stop does not come roaring back, which will do if it has the chance. So, I think I'll continue to spend a day or two per week on government matters for as long as the President would like me to do so and as long as it is useful. But starting next month, I'll be allocating probably more of my time to Tesla and now that the major work of establishing the Department of Government Efficiency is done. So, at Tesla, we've gone through many, many crises over the years and actually been through many near-death experiences. We were probably on the ragged edge of death at least on maybe a dozen times. It's been so many times. This is not one of those times. We're not on the ragged edge of death, not even close. So -- but there are some challenges, and I expect that this year will be, there will probably be some unexpected bumps this year. But I remain extremely optimistic about the future of the company. The future of the company is fundamentally based on large-scale autonomous cars and large-scale, large volume, vast numbers of autonomous humanoid robots. So the value of a company that makes truly useful autonomous humanoid robots and autonomous useful vehicles at scale at low cost, which is what Tesla is going to do, is staggering. I continue to believe that Tesla, with excellent execution, will be the most valuable company in the world by far. But that's an important if, we must execute well. But if we do execute well, I think Tesla will be the most valuable company in the world by far. It may be as valuable as the next five companies combined. So, but there'll be a few bumps along the road before that happens. I said I think on the last earnings call that we'll start to see the prosperity of autonomy take effect in a material way around the middle of next year. We expect to have these -- be selling fully autonomous rides in June in Austin, as we've been saying for now several months. So that's continued, but the real question from financial standpoint is when does it really become material and affect bottom line of the company and start to be a fundamental part of the -- when does it move the financial needle in a significant way? That's probably around the middle of next year, second half of next year. And then once it does start to move the financial needle in a significant way, it will really go exponential from there. So that's, I'd encourage people to look beyond like the, some sort of bumps and bundles of each road immediately ahead of us. But left your gaze to the bright shining sort of down the hill, I don't know, some Reagan-esque imagery. And that's where we're headed and not too distant future. Like I said, kind of next year or two. So, let's see. With respect to supply chain risk, something that Tesla has been working on for several years is to localize supply chains. This actually makes sense from a cost standpoint and from a logistics risk standpoint, is to have the supply chains be at least located on the continent in which the car is built. And so we are, I think the least, a company, the least affected car company with respect to tariffs, at least in most respects, I mean, it remains to be seen. Now, tariffs are still tough on a company when margins are still low. But we do have localized supply chains in North America, Europe, and China. So that puts us in a stronger position than any of our competitors. And undoubtedly, I'm going to get a lot of questions about tariffs, and I just want to emphasize that the tariff decision is entirely up to the President of the United States. I will weigh in with my advice with the President, which he will listen to my advice, but then it's up to him, of course, to make his decision. I've been on the record many times saying that I believe lower tariffs are generally a good idea for prosperity, but this decision is fundamentally up to the elected representative of the people being the President of the United States. So, you know, I'll continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs, but that's all I can do. So, now let me walk you through why I'm so excited about the future of Tesla. So, first of all, autonomy. The team and I are laser focused on bringing robotaxi to Austin in June. Unsupervised autonomy will first be solved for the Model Y in Austin. And then -- actually you should parse out the terms robotic taxi or robotaxi and just generally like what's the Cybercab because we've got a product called the Cybercab and then any Tesla which could be an S3 extra wide that is autonomous is a robotic taxi or robotaxi. It's very confusing. So the vast majority of the Tesla fleet that we've made is capable of being a robotaxi or robotic taxi. And as we're going from -- once we can make the whole system work where you can have paid rides fully autonomously with no one in the car in one city, that is a very scalable thing for us to go broadly within whatever jurisdiction allows us to operate. So, because we're solving for is a general solution to autonomy, not a city specific solution for autonomy. Once we make it work in a few cities, we can basically make it work in all cities in that legal jurisdiction. So, if it’s -- once we can make it based to work in a few cities in America, we can make it work anywhere in America. Once we can make it work in a few cities in China, we can make it work anywhere in China, likewise in Europe, limited only by regulatory approvals. So, this is the advantage of having a generalized solution using artificial intelligence. And the -- an AI chip that Tesla designed specifically for this purpose as opposed to very expensive sensors and high precision maps of a particular neighborhood where that neighborhood may change or often changes and then the car stops working. So, we have a general solution instead of a specific solution. Then, with regards to Optimus, we’re making good progress in Optimus. We expect to have thousands of Optimus robots working in Tesla factories by the end of this year, 10 years forward. And we expect to scale Optimus up faster than any product, I think, in history, to get to millions of units per year as soon as possible. I think I feel confident in getting to a million units per year in less than five years, maybe five years. So, by 2030, I feel confident in predicting a million Optimus units per year, it might be 2029. So, let's see with respect to energy, energy business is doing very well. The Megapack is -- enables utility companies to output far more total energy than would otherwise be the case. When you think of the energy capability of a grid, it's much more than, say, total energy output per year. If the powerplants could operate at peak power for all 24 hours, as opposed to being at half power, sometimes a quarter power at night, then you could double the energy output of existing power plants. But in order to do that, you need to buffer the energy, so that you can charge up something like a battery pack at night and then discharge into the grid during the day. So, this is a massive unlock on total energy output of any given grid over the course of a year. And utility companies are beginning to realize this and are buying in our Megapacks at scale. So, at this point, a gigawatt class battery is quite a common thing. So, we have many orders and offer for gigawatt and beyond batteries. And we expect the energy -- the stationary energy storage business to scale ultimately to terawatts per year. So very, very good numbers. Now, Q1, first quarters of a year are usually pretty tricky. Because it's usually the worst quarter of the year because people don't want to go buy a car in the middle of winter during the blizzard. So we picked Q1 as a good quarter to do a cutover to the new version of the Model Y and we changed production of the world's best selling cars with -- remember the Model Y is the best selling car of any kind on earth with a 1.1 billion unit per year output of a single model. And we did this changeover at the same time in factories all across the world. So congratulations to the Tesla team on an amazing job in pulling off what is a very difficult transition. So yeah, it's really very impressive work. So, yeah. In conclusion, while there are many near-term headwinds for us and the border industry, the future for Tesla is brighter than ever. The value of the company is delivering sustainable abundance with our affordable AI powered robots. So this, I like this phrase, sustainable abundance for all. If you say, like, what's the ideal future that you can imagine? That's what you'd want. You'd want abundance for all in a way that's sustainable. It's good for the environment. Basically, this is the happy future. If you say what's the happiest future you can imagine. One which is that would be a future where there's sustainable abundance for all. Closest thing to heaven we can get on Earth, basically. So, thank you again to the test team for all their efforts of the challenging time. I look forward to continuing to lead the team to great success in the future."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,4,Travis Axelrod,"Great. Thank you very much, Elon. Before we move on, Vaibhav has some opening remarks as well."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,5,Vaibhav Taneja,"Thanks, Elon. As Elon mentioned, in Q1, we achieved something which has never been undertaken in the automotive industry of updating all our factories for the best-selling car in the world, all at the same time. And this is, people don't understand, this was not a small feat. We're not aware of anybody else being able to do the best-selling car all at once within a quarter. And that too hitting all the timelines which we had established at the beginning. So, big kudos to the team for making this happen. Additionally, we also hit record gross profit for energy storage business in the quarter. Now, getting back into the business, there has been a lot of speculation as to the reasons for decline of our vehicle deliveries in the first quarter. We had previously guided that we will be updating all factories and this will lead to several weeks of lost production, which did happen as planned. The ripple effect of the change is not having enough new Model Y available in most markets for people to see and experience till the last few weeks of the quarter. Additionally, the negative impact of vandalism and unwanted hostility towards our brand and our people had an impact in certain markets. Despite this, we were able to sell out legacy Model Y in US, China, and a few other markets within the world. And again, just so that people understand, we were producing the legacy Model Y till middle to end of February. And we switched over and we were able to still sell out within that period. So, again, big achievement by all the people at Tesla to make it happen. We've been extremely -- we have a very extremely competitive vehicle lineup, which with most vehicles going through a recent update, and add to that, if it wants an FSD, you have a personal chauffeur which can take you almost anywhere under supervision. There are numerous stories shared by customers ranging from how it has improved their daily commute, to providing mobility to customers with disabilities, to giving older customers the ability to travel comfortably and independently. Not only is FSD Supervised safer than a human driver, but it is also improving the lives of individuals who experience it. And again, this is something you have to experience, and anybody who has experience just knows it. And we've been doing a lot lately to try and get those stories out, at least on X, so that people can see how other people have benefited from this. Now, coming into some of the financial stuff, auto margins declined sequentially primarily due to a reduction in the total number of deliveries, lower fixed cost absorption due to factory change awards and lower regulatory credit revenues offset by a slight increase in pricing due to the launch of new Model Y despite incentives which we had to sell legacy Model Y. Our energy storage business, like I said before, has achieved yet another milestone of create highest gross profit in the quarter. This was despite sequential decline in deployments. The importance of this business, as Elon mentioned, is pretty profound, especially in this environment. Because, in order for our grid to work properly with the demands from AI and all this, you need some more stability. This is by far the simplest and best solution, which we are aware of, which can help do this. And we've also developed certain unique solutions to help our customers to achieve this. Additionally, on the Powerwall side, we've been selling the new Powerwall 3, and it's been received with very good reception from customers, and to the extent that we are currently supply constraint. On services and other margins, they were slightly down sequentially, primarily because of the pressure on our used car business and insurance business. Note that we continued our journey to improve profitability in our services and collision business through better labor productivity. As previously discussed, our operating expenses continue to increase sequentially, primarily due to our AI-related initiatives, including Optimus, and also cost of development for our vehicle programs, including Cybercabs, SEMA, and cheaper models. These expenses flow through R&D. We believe even in the current environment, it is the right strategy, in making investments in these areas to position us for the long term. These increases were offset by decreases in SG&A changes in our vertical effort program. Other income reduced significantly on a sequential basis. The primary reason was Bitcoin mark to market loss in Q1 versus gain in Q4, resulting in a $472 million drop. The remainder of the change is because of FX reimbursement. With the adoption of the new mark to market standard for Bitcoin, we expect increased volatility in other income in addition to the FX volatility. I know tariffs is the hottest topic which people talk about and it has various impacts to our business. And as Elon mentioned, on the vehicle business, we've been on this journey of regionalization for years. Specifically in the US, Model Y has been rated the most American model made car on Cars.com Made in America index three years ago. [This end product] (ph) of the all the work which team has been doing all the years and to the extent that today, if you look at our vehicle lineup in US, we're about approximately on a weighted average basis 85% USMCA compliant. So, like Elon said, this definitely gives us a bigger edge as compared to our other OEMs in terms of managing the tariffs, but we're not immune because when the Section 232 auto tests become effective in May, which includes Canada and Mexico, and Canada and Mexico has been part of our regionalization study. They will have an impact on profitability. And I know research modeling on this impact has been up about a couple of thousand units which is pretty much in line with what we've been forecasting. The impact of tariffs on the energy business will be outsized since we source LFP battery cells from China. We're in the process of commissioning equipment for the local manufacturing of LFP battery cells in the US. However, the equipment which we have can only service a fraction of our total installed capacity of late. We've also been working on securing additional supply chain from non-China based suppliers, but it will take time. Also note that, in spite of all the impact on US from energy -- from tariffs on the energy business, we do have a Megafactory China which just started operations in Q1, and that should take care of our business outside of the US. There's also an important impact of tariffs on our capital investments. I know this is going to sound counterintuitive since in order to launch manufacturing or expand lines, we have to bring equipment from outside the US because there is not that much capacity in the US. And the current trade environment, such equipment being brought in is subjective."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,6,Elon Musk,The expense is bringing in from China right now.
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,7,Vaibhav Taneja,"Exactly. And the reality is that China has the basic one, which has the most capacity to provide [indiscernible]. Our CapEx guidance inclusive of [tariffs] (ph), even with the optimization we have tried to do, it is forecasted to be still in excess of 10 billion this year. We're still evaluating what more to do on this one. To summarize, we have near-term challenges in our business due to tariffs and brand image. We think our strategy of providing the best product at a competitive price is going to be a winner, and this is the reason we're still focused on bringing cheaper models to market soon. The start of production is still planned for June. Additionally, the advancement in FSD related features, including pilot robotaxi launch in Austin later this year, should help create a new era of demand. I would like to thank everyone at Tesla and our customers."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,8,Travis Axelrod,"Fantastic. Thank you very much, Vaibhav."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,9,A - Travis Axelrod,"Now, we will move on to investor questions. We will start with questions from say.com. First question is, what are the highest risk items on the critical path to robotaxi launch and scaling?"
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,10,Ashok Elluswamy,It is Ashok.
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,11,Travis Axelrod,"Yeah, we've got Ashok on line."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,12,Elon Musk,"Sure. Well, just to talk about the -- disambiguate Cybercab from robotaxi once again. So, the -- when will -- the Tesla's because the Tesla's that will be fully autonomous in June in Austin are probably Model Ys. So, that is currently on track to be able to do paid rides fully autonomously in Austin in June and then to be in many other cities in the US by the end of this year. It's very difficult to predict the exact ramp sort of week by week and month by month except that it will ramp up very quickly. So, it's going to be like some basically an S curve where it's very difficult to predict the intermediate slope of the S curve, but you kind of know where the S curve is going to end up, which is the vast majority of the Tesla fleet being autonomous. So, that's why I feel confident in predicting large scale autonomy around the middle of next year, but yeah. Certainly the second half of next year, meaning, I predict that there will be millions of Tesla's operating autonomously, fully autonomously in the second half of next year. Yeah. It does seem increasingly likely that there will be a localized parameter set, especially for places that have, say, very snowy weather, like, say, if you're in the northeast or something. Like this, you can think of it, it's kind of like a human. Like, if you, you can be a very good driver in California, but are you going to be also a good driver in a blizzard in Manhattan? You're not going to be as good. So there is actually some value in, you still drive, but you're probably, of an accident is higher. So it's increasingly obvious that there's some value to having a localized set of parameters for different regions and localities. But this is -- I’ll put that in the nice-to-have category, not -- it's not the required category. Again, it's -- really the car is, it's just very much like the human. It's digital neural nets and cameras and humans operate with biological neural nets and eyes. And so the same strengths and weaknesses will be present. Or, a digital neural net and cameras versus a biological neural net and eyes. Ashok, if you'd like to elaborate on that."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,13,Ashok Elluswamy,"Yeah, speaking to the location specific models, we still have a generalized approach and you can see that from deployment of FSD Supervised in China, with this very minimal data that's China specific, the models generalize quite well to completely different driving styles. That just shows that the AI-based solution that we have is the right one because if you have gone down the previous rule-based solutions or like more hard-coded HD map-based solutions, it would have taken many, many years to get China to work. You can see those in the videos that people post online themselves. So, the generalized solution that we are pursuing is the right one that's going to scale well. And you can think of this location specific parameters that you don't need to ask a mixture of experts. And if you are sort of like familiar with the AI models, the Grok and others, they all use this mixture of experts to sort of like specialize the parameters to specific tasks while still being general. This makes the model use limited amount of compute to solve for the diversity of tasks that it has to solve. In terms of addressing the question that asked for, what are the critical things that need to get right, one thing I would like to note is validation. Self-driving is a long-tail problem where there can be a lot of edge cases that only happen very, very rarely. Currently, we are driving around in Austin using our QA fleet, but then it's super rare to get interventions that are critical for robotaxi operation. And so you can go many days without getting any single intervention. So you can't easily know whether you are improving or regressing in your capacity. And we need to build out sophisticated simulations, including neural network based video generation. That's all happening in the background to make sure that we deliver a safe product and we are able to measure our safety even though we can't just exceed when we're driving around the block or something like that."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,14,Elon Musk,"Yeah, I mean, very basic terms. If that -- if we're seeing an accident every 10,000 miles, well, then you have to drive 10,000 miles of average before you get an accident or an intervention. So, it's like, okay, I mean, we must be really, you don’t have to be very worked out by the sheer number of Teslas doing [indiscernible] in Austin right now. We're like, it's going to look pretty bizarre."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,15,Ashok Elluswamy,Some people are chasing us away.
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,16,Elon Musk,"Yeah, there's just always a convoy of Teslas going. Well, just going all over to Austin in circles. But yeah, I just can't emphasize this enough, in order to get -- figure out long tail things, it was one in 10,000, that says one in 20,000 miles, well one in 30,000. The average person drives 10,000 miles in a year. So, now try to compress that test cycle into a matter of a few months. That means you need a lot of cars doing a lot of driving in order to compress that or to do in a matter of a month what would normally take someone a year."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,17,Ashok Elluswamy,"Yeah, and I would just also add that if you haven't looked at those videos coming out of China, people are really…"
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,18,Elon Musk,"Yeah, those videos are amazing."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,19,Ashok Elluswamy,"Yeah, they're putting it to real test. I mean, they're dark roads."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,20,Elon Musk,"Frankly, I think the Chinese consumer might be the most [American] (ph) consumer and, I actually, our customers in China are awesome. They have a lot of fun with the cars. I saw one guy take a Tesla on -- autonomous on a narrow road across like a mountain. And I'm like, very brave person. And the Tesla's driving along on a road with no barriers where he makes a mistake, he's going to plunge to his doom. But it worked."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,21,Travis Axelrod,"Great. Thank you. And the question was on Cybercab itself, we're in B sample validation now."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,22,Elon Musk,"Yeah, we should ask that question too."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,23,Travis Axelrod,"Yeah, we have our first big builds coming at the end of this quarter in Q2. And then in the coming months, we start to large scale installation of all the equipment in Giga Texas with still on schedule for production next year."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,24,Travis Axelrod,Yeah. And I just want to also to clarify because I think people don't understand the thing that there's no new building being built and where is Cybercab going to -- literally the same factory.
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,25,Lars Moravy,It's happening and people don't know it’s just happening upstairs all the long lines while we're still building the Model Ys and Cybertrucks every day.
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,26,Elon Musk,Yeah. So it's worth noting that the Tesla Gigafactory at Austin is three times the size of the Pentagon.
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,27,Lars Moravy,Including the garden.
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,28,Elon Musk,"Yeah, including the ground zero garden. And I’d go visit Pentagon like, this building used to look big, but then you won’t."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,29,Travis Axelrod,"Great. Thank you very much. The next question is, when will FSD Unsupervised be available for personal use on personally-owned cars?"
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,30,Elon Musk,"Before the end of this year. Not necessarily -- I say within the US, like we do want to test -- at Tesla, we're absolutely hardcore about safety. We go to great lengths to make the safest car in the world and have the lowest accidents per mile in. So -- and look, fewest lives lost. So we want to be very careful. So we want autonomy to be definitively safer than manual driving. So it's not enough that it just be as safe. It needs to be meaningfully safer than if it's cars mainly driven. And we want to confirm that there's not something -- we just want to be cautious with the rollout. We don't want to jump in at the deep end with an army. So with that said, I think we should -- people should -- we should be able to have it work in several cities later this year for personal use. So the acid test being you should be able to -- can you go to sleep in your car and wait until your destination? And I'm confident that it will be available in many cities in the US by the end of this year."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,31,Travis Axelrod,"Great. Thank you very much. The next question is, is Tesla still on track for releasing more affordable models this year? Or will you be focusing on simplifying versions to enhance affordability similar to the rear-wheel drive Cybertruck?"
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,32,Lars Moravy,"Yeah, we're still planning to release models this year. As with all launches, we're working through like the last-minute issues that pop up. We're not getting down one by one. At this point, I would say that ramp maybe -- might be a little slower than we had hoped initially, but there's nothing, just kind of given the turmoil that exists in the industry right now. But there's nothing blocking us from starting production within the next -- within the timeline laid out in the opening remarks. And I will say, it's important to emphasize that as we've said all along, the full utilization of our factories is the primary goal for these new products. And so flexibility of what we can do within the form factor and the design of it is really limited to what we can do in our existing lines rather than build new ones. But we've been targeting the low cost of ownership. Monthly payment is the biggest differentiator for our vehicles. And that's why we're focused on bringing these new models with the big, new lowest price to the market within the constraints of selling."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,33,Travis Axelrod,"Great. Thank you very much. The next question is, does Tesla see robotaxi as a winner-take-most market? And as you approach the Austin launch, how do you expect to compare against Waymo's offering, especially regarding pricing, geofencing and regulatory flexibility?"
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,34,Elon Musk,"Well, okay. The issue with Waymo's cars is it costs way more money, but that is the issue. The car is very expensive, made in low volume. Teslas are probably cost 25% or 20% of what a Waymo costs and made in very high volume. So, ironically, like, we’re the ones to make the bet that a pure AI solution with cameras and what do you have? The car actually will listen for sirens and that kind of thing. It's the right move. And Waymo decided that an expensive sensor suite is the way to go, even though Google is very good at AI. So I'm wondering. And it is worth noting that Tesla has both an incredible AI software team and AI hardware chip design team, prospect [indiscernible]. So yeah, it's really -- I mean, I don't see anyone being able to compete with Tesla at present. I'm sure that'll change eventually, but at least as far as I'm aware, because we will have, I don't know, 99% market share or something ridiculous. That 90-something-percent, at least, I don't know, some of them might change, but if we have millions of cars deployed next year unless others have millions of cars deployed, like, we'll have -- unless we're blocked by regulatory situations, it won't be long. I mean, in a few years, we'll have 10 million autonomous cars on the roads and counting."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,35,Ashok Elluswamy,"The other thing which people forget is like we're not just developing the software solution, we are also manufacturing the cars. And like, Waymo has, they're taking cars and then trying to put..."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,36,Elon Musk,Waymo in it.
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,37,Ashok Elluswamy,"We don't do that, so that definitely gives us a big leg-up. And like Elon said, we only have a big existing fleet which hopefully, with a software update could become autonomous."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,38,Elon Musk,"With software update, it will become autonomous. To be clear, the Model Y that we are talking about in being autonomous in Austin in June are the Model Ys we make currently, there's no change to it."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,39,Ashok Elluswamy,I think people don't appreciate that the car they can buy today...
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,40,Elon Musk,The car that they have.
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,41,Ashok Elluswamy,Are the car they have is capable of these kind of things.
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,42,Vaibhav Taneja,"In fact, it does drive autonomously from the factory to the end of line, every car nowadays."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,43,Lars Moravy,"That runs through the tunnel, the Model Y is everything."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,44,Elon Musk,"Right. Yes, exactly. We have -- it has been pointed to use -- it's doing useful work fully autonomously at the factories as Ashok was mentioning. The car is driving itself from end of line to where it was supposed to be picked up by a truck to be taken to a customer. And I'm confident also that later this year, the first Model Y will drive itself all the way to the customer. So, from our -- probably from our factory in Austin and one in here in Fremont, California, I'm confident that from both factories, we'll be able to drive directly to a customer on the factory."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,45,Lars Moravy,Cool delivery.
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,46,Elon Musk,"Yeah, literally goes from the end of line and drive themselves to your house."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,47,Lars Moravy,"It's important to note in the factories, we don't have dedicated lengths or anything. People are coming out every day, trucks delivering supplies, parts, construction."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,48,Elon Musk,"And people can film it. By the way, you can see this from the road. Like, it’s not covered. And there’s many people take videos online. And anyone who wants to see it and just drive past our Fremont factory and see the autonomous cars driving themselves. And they drive themselves and they put themselves in the exact right spot to be picked up."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,49,Lars Moravy,"Yeah, the logistics yard is right there in the open. We don't move it again to another lane."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,50,Elon Musk,"They go to a specific spot, parking spot. Yeah. So that's just a routine like everyday thing now."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,51,Travis Axelrod,"Great. Thank you very much. The next question is, can you please provide an update on the unboxed method and how that has progressed?"
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,52,Lars Moravy,"Sure. It's progressing, absolutely. As I mentioned just a minute ago, like it is the basis for our Cybercab manufacturing process. It's really what we changed in order to allow the low cost of production and also get the super high levels of automation. Really, levels of automation that are sort of unheard of in the vehicle manufacturing scale. This is like not something that when you see it be produced, you'll think of in terms of, like, wow, this car has been built for 100 years. It's really something we’ve changed. In the past year, we've been like focusing on a lot of key development areas like, marrying these large subassemblies together in a precise way, in an accurate way. We've also derisked things like corrosion of uncoated aluminum structures, the ceiling across the seams of the vehicle and when you marry several components. And we've even done early crash testing and improvement that like it's going to be just as safe as the other car we build. So like we're -- as with all that combined, we kind of go into the builds that we have in this quarter for the Cybercab product, and that's the next real big test of full-scale integration with the unboxed process. And that's kind of where we are. So you'll see them on the test roads in a couple of months."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,53,Elon Musk,Yeah. Although the line won't be at this rate…
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,54,Lars Moravy,Initially.
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,55,Elon Musk,"Initially, this is a revolutionary production system. I’m not sure what the right word is. Unboxing sounds like something when you get your phone."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,56,Lars Moravy,And you open it up.
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,57,Elon Musk,"You have like a pleasant experience when you take your phone out of the box, which of course is nice, but this is more revolutionary than that. This is a profound reimagining of how to make cars in the first place. No car is made like this anywhere in the world. The factory is the product as much as the car is the product. So, this really is the first principles approach to manufacturing that will ultimately allow us, I think, to -- I’m trying to think, I'm confident, ultimately allow us to achieve a cycle time, meaning a unit every five seconds or less, off a single line."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,58,Ashok Elluswamy,And we want to incorporate some of these for testing into our existing production lines as well with the Cybertruck already.
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,59,Elon Musk,"I mean, this is something I've been thinking about for a long time and sort of thinking about this a long time, and it's kind of -- it's not a crazy thing. Like a car every five seconds may sound like it's coming out like bullets, but actually it's coming out at walking speed."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,60,Ashok Elluswamy,It's a meter a second.
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,61,Elon Musk,"A meter a second. So this is like we're still far away from caring about the ergonomic drag of the manufacturing line because you're still at 3 miles an hour. Every five second sounds crazy but it's 3 miles an hour that we're talking about. So yeah, you can run away from it basically. But that's still, by far, and fastest line on Earth, and it's like half hour make, [indiscernible]"
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,62,Lars Moravy,Shanghai phase 2. 33 seconds.
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,63,Elon Musk,"We're the fastest, right?"
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,64,Lars Moravy,I would think so.
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,65,Elon Musk,"We think we're the fastest at 33 seconds in our Shanghai factory, but this would be six times faster or seven times faster, thereabouts. I mean, it'll be slower than that but the point is that like when you fully optimize the design and you’ve got operation of the next-generation factory that we're building right now, the 5-second cycle time or less is, the design is capable of it. So if you -- when you go through like new architecture, you go from like being like in any -- I mean, probably China in particular is an A+ on a moderately, an advanced but still traditional car production system. So they're really in about as good as possible to do within in a conventional scenario. So trying to get much below, sort of below like 30 seconds, extremely difficult. But, and you start getting into sort of impossible where you just -- you have to be faster than a human could possibly move. So then the autonomous line, it really just needs to be robust moving really fast, and that's where you get to sub-5 seconds. But we'll start off with getting a C and a new architecture, but then the potential is there over time to move them up to an A+, within an A+ architecture."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,66,Travis Axelrod,"Great. Thank you very much. The next question is, how is Tesla positioning itself to flexibly adapt to global economic risks and form of tariffs, political biases, et cetera?"
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,67,Vaibhav Taneja,"As Elon said, we've been [indiscernible] team for a while. We continue to mitigate global economic risks like tariffs and political biases by regionalizing part supply factories in North America, Berlin and Shanghai. For example, in North America, our high-volume vehicle programs have over 85% North America content and Shanghai vehicles have over 95% local content. Berlin has similar levels of regionalization as North American when you exclude the battery, and we are working on regionalizing the battery as well. This is a pre-pandemic strategy that we accelerated post pandemic through supply diversification, dual-sourcing, vertical integration, advanced analytics, and local partnerships to ensure supply chain resilience and production stability. Having said that, we are not 100% insulated and these tariffs rates are higher on our low volume platforms than the high-volume ones."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,68,Elon Musk,"Yeah. There's no more vertically integrated car company than Tesla. I mean, we're taking -- we're most vertically integrated car company since Henry Ford back in the day when they're doing mining iron and stuff and growing rubber trees. Like we're not growing rubber trees and mining iron yet. But we are -- we have both a lithium refinery in South Texas. And it's -- I mean, the biggest lithium refinery outside of China, I think. Is that right?"
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,69,Unidentified Company Representative,Yeah. I think so.
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,70,Elon Musk,"But it has -- its upward potential would be the biggest lithium refinery outside -- and we've got to expand and build more, right. And then we've got the catheter refinery in Austin next to Gigafactory. We've got to figure out what to do about the anode. This is an ongoing subject of discussion. The best of all possible would be figuring how to have no anode. Best part being no part. That's the dream of the lithium batteries to be not having anode. But either way, we better have the anode, the cathode and the lithium and the electrolytes, separator to make a cell. But there's no other car company that has both lithium refineries and cathode refineries. We're ridiculously vertically integrated, and thus are best positioned to protect against supply chain disruptions. You want to talk that progress?"
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,71,Unidentified Company Representative,"Yeah. Certainly, for our in-house cells, we've multi-sourced every component. We have every path coming from at least two different countries of origin, which is we started this -- the supply chain team and the engineering team worked together on this for the last couple of years to put that together. It's not something we did in a couple of months. This is years of work. So we're in a good position to take advantage of that and the in-sourcing of lithium and cathode, the two most critical parts that actually does run that backyard and we're totally insulated from."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,72,Elon Musk,I think it need to be an operation.
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,73,Unidentified Company Representative,I think it need to be an operation.
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,74,Elon Musk,"We also make our own cells by the way. Cell production, if you took this -- you make the anode, the cathode, the lithium, the electrolyte separator, can and then you got to put all that together in the cell factory and there are entire companies that only do is produce cells but they don't do the other stuff, refine lithium or the cathode or. So, our cell production is going quite well. And I think we're, we’re a company sort of the lowest cost per kilowatt hour."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,75,Unidentified Company Representative,All cells we purchase in North America.
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,76,Elon Musk,"Yeah. So we have the lowest cost per kilowatt hour, all things considered. So the Tesla cell is the most competitive cell. Yeah, for a kilowatt hour bringing to a car, it's a Tesla cell, it's lower cost than a supplier cell."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,77,Unidentified Company Representative,"Yes. And the plan this year is to really build off that base. Getting to lowest cost is, it's the hardest challenge for so many entry. It's relatively easy to build a flashy product that does one thing well. To build something at high volume, low cost is super difficult, and we're kind of using that space to let go off and add performance in different areas for new products coming out."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,78,Lars Moravy,"Yeah. I mean, to Elon's point, there's a lot of advantages for regionalization. The most important thing is we're maximizing the working capital for six to eight weeks on the ocean. If there's a design change, then everything that's in transit basically has to be scrapped. Secondly, port disruptions, as we saw during COVID, can be very expensive because slide disconnects can shut down production. So then your only option is costly expedite. It also gives us resilience in supply chain. If one region is down, we can bridge with others. It's more to set up in the beginning, but it's critical to have when the need arises. Having said that, it's unrealistic there's 100% regionalization across the board for specialized areas such as semiconductors. In such cases, our teams works very closely with our partners to ensure we have strategic banks in place and disruption doesn't impact production while we stand up the regional manufacturing for that particular commodity."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,79,Unidentified Company Representative,"And I'll say like unless the vehicle, like Elon was talking about with cells, we’re also heavily integrated, important ingots, internal castings, we recycle those and melt some. There's the same thing with plastics, but it doesn't mean we're not exposed. We do have some areas where we use magnets and we've been working for years to find alternative sources and bring those up as well as we have machines. And as we've mentioned in the past, we're working on ferrite numbers for some time. So like, as Karn said, with our heavy regionalization percentages, we definitely like the lowest exposed to this, but we're not completely immune as Vaibhav mentioned."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,80,Travis Axelrod,Great. Similarly related on the battery side. Is Tesla still battery supply constrained as noted on the Q4 call and does that change with tariffs?
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,81,Karn Budhiraj,"This is Karn. We've been working very hard to expand battery cell production in the US, both with vendors and what Bonnie mentioned earlier with the 4680 program. And we're also working on moving the upstream supply chain for battery cells to the United States for several years. And that strategy is really starting to pay off now. As it stands right now, we're not constrained on battery cell supply for vehicles. The recent tariffs do pose some challenges to Tesla Energy, well, like our CFO mentioned earlier, but it's something we've been anticipating and we should be able to resolve in a timely fashion. We actually have a kind of place right going towards it. We also have some other sources coming online to supplement the shortfall. And then of course, we have the production that's happening in-house. We have a slight disconnect of aligning the right cells with the right path. So that's the little bit of puzzle that we have to solve internally. But as far as cells go, there's no shortage."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,82,Travis Axelrod,"Great. Thank you very much. The next question is, did Tesla experience any meaningful changes in order inflow rate in Q1 relating to all the rumors of brand damage?"
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,83,Unidentified Company Representative,"In Q1, as I mentioned earlier, we took the best-selling car over the last two years and ramped up all four of our global factories. And in less than eight weeks, we've already gone to the rate of our previous Model Ys in the factories. So, just kudos again to the team for the great job there. And despite the economic strain and negative articles, in California in Q1, Tesla remained the best-selling car, not just EV. And additionally, we had a record number of test drives globally in Q1 as well. So, interest remains high. And so right now, we continue to see good interest still on vehicle."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,84,Elon Musk,"Yeah. I mean, Tesla is immune to sort of the macro demand for cars. So when there is economic uncertainty, people generally want to pause on buying, doing a major capital purchase like a car. But as far as absent macro issues, we don't see any reduction in demand."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,85,Unidentified Company Representative,Correct. And that's what we're continuing to focus on affordability. And it's fun to focus there.
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,86,Travis Axelrod,"Fantastic. Thank you guys. The next question is regarding the Tesla Optimus pilot line, could you confirm if it is currently operational? If so, what is the current production rate of Optimus bots per week? Additionally, how might the recent tariffs impact the scalability of this production line moving forward?"
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,87,Elon Musk,"I want to emphasize Optimus is still very much a development program. It's not a large volume production. This year, we'll make a few -- we do expect to make thousands of Optimus robots, but most of that production is going to be at the end of the year. So the -- almost everything in Optimus is new. There's not like an existing supply chain for the motors, gearboxes, electronics, actuators, really anything in the Optimus apart from the AI for Tesla -- Tesla AI computer, which is the same as the one in the car. So when you have a new complex manufactured product, it will move as fast as the slowest and least lucky component in the entire thing. And as opposed to proximation, there's like 10,000 unique things. So, that's why anyone who tells you they can predict with precision the production ramp of the truly new product is -- doesn't know what they're talking about. It is totally impossible. So, you go through this like a series of constraints where I would think this part is a limiting factor, now that part is a limiting factor, and this part is a limiting factor and multiply that by 1,000 basically. And then the rate of the production is decided by how quickly you can solve each of those problems. Now, Optimus was affected by the magnet issue from China because the Optimus actuators in the arm do use permanent magnets. Now Tesla as a whole is not me to use permanent magnets. But when something is volume constrained, like an arm of the robot, then you want to try to make the motors as small as possible. And then so we did the design in permanent magnets for those motors, and those were affected by the supply chain, by basically China requiring an export license to send out anywhere with magnets. So, we’re working through that with China. Hopefully, we’ll get a license to use the rare earth magnets. China wants some assurances that these are not used for military purposes, which, obviously, they’re not. They’re just going into a humanoid robot. So that’s not a weapon system. But that that is certainly an example of a challenge there. But I’m confident we’ll overcome these issues, and we’ll, by the end of this year, have thousands of populous robots."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,88,Travis Axelrod,"Great. Thank you very much. And the last question, we already covered earlier, whether Robotaxi was still on track for this year. So, with that, we can move on to analyst questions. The first question is going to come from Pierre at New Street. Pierre, please unmute yourself."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,89,Pierre Ferragu,"Hey, guys. Can you hear me?"
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,90,Elon Musk,Yeah.
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,91,Pierre Ferragu,"That's great. I'm super excited to hear robotaxi and Optimus becoming the very tangible future for Tesla. But I have actually a question on the legacy, not legacy, in the current like auto business. And when I look back to the ramp of Model 3 a few years ago, I really saw it as being the iPhone of cars, a new product, completely reinvented, very different user experience, vastly superior, impossible to match for traditional competitors. And for the iPhone, which resulted in the high end of the smartphone market quadrupling in size and actually Apple taking 60% market share. And so when you look at the Model 3 and the Model Y today, I think they are still actually vastly superior to any other cars. And I wonder why they've taken about 15% of their addressable market and not more actually? So, another way to put it is, why are there so many people still buying BMWs and Mercedes, knowing that Model 3 and the Model Ys are out there and available? And I wonder if you're trying to solve that internally. If you understand why -- what are these auto buyers buying a Model 3 or Model Y missing? And if you have ideas of things you could do to address that, maybe there is enormous value left on the table there. Yeah, that's what I'm wondering these days."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,92,Elon Musk,"Yeah. The reality is that, in the future, most people are not going to buy cars. So it’s kind of what, one could sort of say, look, if you think one to continue with your phone metaphor, I mean, you can remember the days of the flip phones when there was a hundred different flip phone designs. And I would, the mistake that lump manufacturers made was to try to make that many different variants of a flip bone, but which was a mistake. They should have made the iPhone. So, because obviously everyone’s going to want a smartphone. But in the beginning of when the iPhone came out, I was like, wow, I can’t believe these guys are not reacting as though this is death. But they didn’t, they kept making the variants of smartphones. Nokia, I think, at one point was the most valuable company in the world or close to it, but they kept making flip phones. Trying to find another market niche. Maybe somebody wants a phone of a different style, maybe this different color or whatever it is. Nope. They just want a super intelligent phone that can do everything. Just one. So I said this many years ago. But in the in the future, in the not too distant future, buying a gasoline car that is not autonomous will be like riding a horse while using a flip phone. Some people still do it, but it’s rare."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,93,Travis Axelrod,"Great. Thank you. The next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner at Wolfe. Emmanuel, please unmute yourself."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,94,Emmanuel Rosner,"So, Elon, the public version of the FSD software still has a decent amount of, I guess, intermittent human interventions that are required. So, what’s still required for the software on your end to get to a level where it doesn’t need to be supervised? And I’m asking that in the context of, obviously, the June launch being in the next couple of months. What still needs to happen?"
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,95,Unidentified Company Representative,We’re working on a number of items too.
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,96,Elon Musk,Go ahead.
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,97,Unidentified Company Representative,"I mean, we are aware of the interventions that are happening in public bus, and that’s why we are hardcore burning it down. And really speaking, some initial launch city helped us focus on, like, solving all the issues that we face here. For example, like, we’re just focusing on Austin. We’re not, like, solving all the issues that customers in Boston or somewhere else might face. And then here, we just, like, have big list of all the issues, just burn it down, and that’s what the team is working on along with other sort of, like, redundancy issues. For example, if one of the computers goes down, right down the customer fleet, it would, like, throw the red hands and ask you to take over, but we don’t want that kind of situation. So you’re solving both, like, the reliability issues of the autonomy software and also the reliability issues of the system software, like, together for Austin."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,98,Elon Musk,"Yeah. It really just we just worked through a long tail of unusual interventions. So, and these are really very rare. Like, as a single intervention every 10,000 miles. I mean, that’s a lot of driving you got to do to even find one case within Athens."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,99,Unidentified Company Representative,"Yeah. And some interventions that have been due to systematic, like, missing functionality. For example, for handling emergency vehicles correctly, you don’t need to con consume audio as an input. But then the customer facing versions don’t have audio input, but the version that’s in -- that’s going to be in Austin will have audio input and so on."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,100,Emmanuel Rosner,"Okay. But would you have, like, remote operators, for example?"
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,101,Unidentified Company Representative,"I mean, every now and then, if a car gets stuck or something, someone will, like, unblock it. But it’s just because we are a bit conservative and are tend towards more safety than even if we get stuck every now and then, we do have remote support. But it’s not going to be required for safe operation. If anything, it’s just required for more availability."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,102,Elon Musk,"Anyway, it’s only a couple months away, so you can just see for yourself in couple months in Austin."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,103,Travis Axelrod,"Great. Our next question comes from Edison at Deutsche Bank. Edison, please unmute yourself."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,104,Edison Yu,Hi. Thank you very much for the question. So I wanted to ask about the Optimus supply chain going forward. You mentioned very fast ramp up. What do you envision that supply chain looking like? Is it going to require many more suppliers to be in the US now because of the tariffs? How does one kind of think about what needs to happen there?
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,105,Elon Musk,"Let’s see how things settle out. I don’t know yet. Right. I mean, so some things we’re doing as we’ve already talked about, which is that we’re already taking tremendous steps to localize our supply chain. We’re more localized than any other manufacturer, and we have a lot of things underway to increase the localization, to reduce supply chain risk associated with geopolitical uncertainty. Did you have a follow-up?"
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,106,Edison Yu,"Yeah. Wanted to come back actually to the robotaxi then. Do you have a sense on how many cars or how big the scale will be initially and how that might ramp up? I know you’re targeting millions of vehicles in the second half kind of next year. But initially at launch, how many vehicles would be reasonable? And is it going to be as simple as if one goes to Austin, let’s say, in late June or July, you’d be able to request?"
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,107,Elon Musk,"Yeah. We’re still debating the exact number to start off on day one, but it’s, like, I don’t know, maybe 10 or 20 vehicles on day one. And watch it carefully. They scale it up rapidly after that. So, we want to make sure that you’re paying very close attention the first time this happens. But, yeah, you will be able to -- end of end of June or July, just go to Austin and order a Tesla for autonomous drive."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,108,Travis Axelrod,Great. The next question comes from George at Canaccord.
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,109,George Gianarikas,"Hi, thank you for taking my question. It has to do with FSD pricing. Can we envision when you launch unsupervised FSD that there could be sort of a multi-tiered pricing approach to unsupervised versus supervised similar to what you did with autopilot versus FSD in the past? Thank you."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,110,Vaibhav Taneja,"I mean, this is something which we’ve been thinking about. I mean, just so you know, for people who have been trying FSD and who’ve been using FSD, they think given the current pricing is too cheap because for $99, we’re basically getting a personal show."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,111,Elon Musk,"Yeah. I mean, we do need to give people more time to like, they want to look at like, like, key breakpoint is, can you read your text messages or not? Yes. Can you write a text message or not? Because, obviously, people are doing this, by the way, with autonomous cars all the time. And if you just go over drive down the highway and you’ll see people texting while driving, you know, doing 80 miles an hour."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,112,Unidentified Company Representative,And putting on makeup on at the same time.
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,113,Elon Musk,"Yeah. Putting on makeup, doing their hair with them mirror down and texting and driving at 80 miles an hour. This is a common occurrence. So, people eating lunch, you name it. Shaving. So, anyway, but right now, the car is very insistent that you pay attention to the road. So, which reduces the value somewhat because it’s very rigorous about you paying attention to the road. And we’ll gradually lighten up on that with every few weeks or every month, we’ll relax that a little bit, make up so you can be more and more able to do things you want to do and not have the car to manage your attention. So that that that value, it’ll really be profound when you can basically do whatever you want, including sleep or and then that $99 is going to seem like the best $99 you’ve ever spent in your life."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,114,Travis Axelrod,"Great. And, George, do you have a follow-up?"
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,115,George Gianarikas,"My follow-up is about geographic expansion. Just maybe discuss additional markets. There’s been some news around India recently that you could launch, this year and next. Thank you."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,116,Vaibhav Taneja,"So, yeah, I mean, we we’ve been working on getting into India. India is a very hard market. And especially the current and I don’t want to talk just about tariffs, but the current tariff structure with India is that any car which we send in is subject to 70% tariff. Also, like, a 30% luxury tax on it. So, the same car which we’re selling is, like, 100% more expensive than what it is. So that creates a lot of, you know, anxiety. It’s like, people feel, okay, they’re paying too much for the car. And by the way, we’re not getting the money. The local government is getting the money. And that’s why we’ve been very careful trying to figure out when is the right time. We, like I said, we are working on it. It’s a great it would be a great market to enter because India has a big middle class, which we would want to tap in, and that is the market which we want to be in. But, again, these kind of things create a little bit of tension which we’re trying to work around."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,117,Travis Axelrod,"Great. Thank you so much. The next question comes from Adam Jonas at Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, Adam. We can’t hear you, Adam. So, maybe we’ll put you back in the queue, and we’ll move to Colin Langan from Wells Fargo, while Adam figures out his audio. Colin, please unmute yourself."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,118,Colin Langan,Great. Do you hear me?
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,119,Travis Axelrod,Yes.
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,120,Colin Langan,"You’re still sticking with division-only approach. A lot of autonomous people still have a lot of concerns about sun glare, fog, dust. Any color on how you anticipate on getting around those issues? Because of my understanding, it kind of blinds the camera when you get glare and stuff."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,121,Elon Musk,"Actually, it does not blind the camera. The we use an approach which is direct photon count. So when you see the -- a processed image, so the image that goes from the sort of photon counter, so the silicon photon counter that gets goes through a digital sig signal processor or image signal processor, that’s normally what happens. And then that that then the image that you see looks all washed out because if it’s, you point the camera at the sun, the post processing of the photon counting washes things out. It actually adds noise. So part of a breakthrough that we made some time ago was to go with direct photon counting and bypass the image signal processor. And that and then you can drive pretty much straight at the sun, and you can also see in what appears to be the blackest of night. And then here in fog, we can see as well as, like, people can, probably better, but I’d say probably slightly better than people, but than the average person anyway. And yeah."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,122,Colin Langan,So the camera is able to see when there’s direct glare on it. I’m little surprised by that. Okay.
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,123,Elon Musk,Yeah.
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,124,Colin Langan,"Okay. And then just there are obviously media reports the other day that the affordable model was delayed. It doesn’t sound like that’s correct. Those reports also talked about it being more of a cheaper version of the Model Y. Any color on what we should expect? Is it a cheaper version of Model Y, or is it actually going to be a design change with it?"
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,125,Vaibhav Taneja,"So I think Lars already covered it in answering one of the say.com cautions. The real thing which we are trying to focus on is affordability. And using our existing lines, there’s always limitations when you’re using existing lines as to how many different form factors can you bring to. So that’s the way I would say you should think about it. And I don’t know if Lars, anything more to add."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,126,Lars Moravy,"Yeah. And I think I said this before in other calls. Like, with the recent upgrades on the Model 3 and Model Y platforms, we made some pretty great cars at pretty great prices, and we added a bunch of features and things like that. I think it’s easy to consider that, moving forward, Tesla doesn’t make bad cars, and we always make, you know, our intent is not to make a car that is any worse than any car we’ve ever produced in the past. And so, models that come out in next months will be built on our lines and will resemble, in form and shape, the cars we currently make. And the key is that they’ll be affordable, and you’ll be able to buy one."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,127,Travis Axelrod,"Great. We might have time for one last question. Adam, we’ll try your audio again. You want to try to unmute yourself, Adam? All right. Unfortunately, it’s still not working. There you go."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,128,Adam Jonas,"Sorry, guys. Technology."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,129,Travis Axelrod,"Go ahead, Adam"
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,130,Adam Jonas,"Yeah. Hi. Yeah. In the February 28 Joe Rogan interview, Elon, you advocated for a ramp in tariffs, to give people time to adjust. Otherwise, quote, you said the system would break, and bad things would happen. So are things breaking yet? And if the announced -- as if the tariffs as announced remain in place, when would things start breaking?"
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,131,Elon Musk,"Well, at the risk of stating the obvious, I’m not -- I’m one of many advisors to the President, I am not the President. So, and -- but I made my opinion clear to the president and that -- and other people made their opinion clear to the President. He is the -- he listened -- he talks to many people, and he makes his decision. And, I’m hopeful that the President will observe whether my predictions are more accurate than the predictions of others and perhaps weigh my advice differently in the future. We shall see. But, I’m an advocate of predictable tariff structures and generally, I’m an advocate for free trade and lower tariffs. But now, one does need to take a look at where -- if some country is doing something predatory with tariffs or is providing extreme support for -- if a government is providing extreme financial support for a particular industry, then you have to do something to counteract that. So, but I think that’s on a case by case basis strategically. But, the President is the elected representative of the people and his fully within his rights to do what he would like to do."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,132,Adam Jonas,"Okay, Elon. I respect that. Just as just as a follow-up, and thanks again. Between China and the United States, who in your opinion is further ahead on the development of physical AI, specifically on humanoids, and also drones? I’d be interested in. And is it even close and kind of how, yeah seriously."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,133,Elon Musk,"I think you know the answer for drones. I mean a friend of mine, Naval, made this posted on X. I reposted it. But I think a prophetic statement, which is any country that cannot manufacture its own drones is doomed to be the vassal state of any country that can. And we can’t America cannot currently manufacture its own drones. But that’s again, unfortunately. So, China, I believe, manufactures about 70% of all drones. And if you look at the total supply chain, China is almost a 100% of drones, are have a supply chain dependency on China. So, China is in a very strong position. And, here in America, and we need to shift more of our people and resources to manufacturing because this is and I have a lot of respect for China because I think China is amazing, actually. But the United States should not have such a severe dependency on China for drones and be unable to make them unless China gives us the parts, which is currently the situation. With respect to humanoid robots, I don’t think there’s any company in any country that can match Tesla. Tesla and SpaceX are number one. So, and then now I’m a little concerned that on the leaderboard, ranks two through 10 will be Chinese companies. But I’m confident that rank one will be Tesla."
8571d2387cdf84f77bcdfbb41b47e157,134,Travis Axelrod,"Great. Well, I think that’s unfortunately all the time we have for today. We appreciate all your questions and look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you very much, and goodbye."
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,1,Travis Axelrod,"Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's Second Quarter 2025 Q&A Webcast. My name is Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Vaibhav Taneja and a number of other executives. Our Q2 results were announced at about 3:00 p.m. Central Time, and the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. [Operator Instructions] Before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?"
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,2,Elon R. Musk,"Thanks, Travis. So we've had a very exciting quarter. We were able to successfully launch robotaxi, so providing our first drives with no one in the driver seat with paying customers in Austin. And as some may have noted, we've already expanded our service area in Austin. It's bigger and longer. And it's going to get even bigger and longer. We were expecting to really greatly increase the Austin service area to well in excess of what competitors are doing. And that's hopefully in a week or so, 2 weeks?"
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,3,Vaibhav Taneja,"Yes, a couple of weeks."
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,4,Elon R. Musk,"A couple of weeks or so. And we're getting the regulatory permission to launch in the Bay Area, Nevada, Arizona, Florida, and a number of other places. So as we get the approvals and we prove out safety, then we will be launching autonomous ride-hailing in most of the country. And I think we'll probably have autonomous ride-hailing in probably half the population of the U.S. by the end of the year. That's at least our goal, subject to regulatory approvals. I think we'll technically be able to do it. So assuming we get regulatory approvals, it's probably addressing half of the population in the U.S. by the end of the year. But we are being very cautious. We don't want to take any chances. And so we're going to go cautiously. But the service areas and the number of vehicles in operation will increase at a hyper-exponential rate. So some other notable things. Model Y in June became the best-selling car in Turkey, Netherlands, Switzerland and Austria. It is, I believe, the best-selling car of any kind in the world still. And autonomy is a big factor there. So even without -- even absent -- even without supervised -- even with just supervised self-driving, it's a huge selling point. And it's worth noting that we do not actually yet have approval for supervised FSD in Europe. So our sales in Europe, we think, will improve significantly once we are able to give customers the same experience that they have in the U.S. This is, I think, a very important point to convey. And we've been working with our main country regulator, which is the Netherlands. And I think we're close to getting approval with the Netherlands, then it's got to go to the EU. It's quite Kafka-esque. In fact, Kafka had no idea that something like the EU could exist beyond Kafka-esque challenges with bureaucracy. But we will get the approvals. And I think we'll get -- some people in Europe will have an experience similar to that of the U.S. in most of Europe this year, hopefully, at least partly in this quarter. And then we also have some regulatory challenges in China, which we're hoping to unblock shortly where we -- because we also cannot provide supervised FSD in China currently, but we hope to unblock that soon. That's also -- that's another major -- it really is the single biggest demand driver. And then within the U.S., as we get confident about safety in different geographic areas, we'll loosen up on how much somebody has to be laser-focused -- to have their eyes laser-focused on the road. That's been a common complaint. In fact, it does create an odd safety issue where people will sometimes disengage autopilot, then do something, change the radio or maybe look at the phone, drive with their knee and then reengage autopilot, which obviously is less safe than simply keeping autopilot on. So anyway, that experience will improve in the next several weeks. Because of our focus on Austin with no one in the driver seat, the production release of autopilot is actually several months behind what people experience on a robotaxi in Austin. So now we have the robotaxi launched, we'll be adding back those elements so that there will be a step-change improvement in the autopilot experience for people outside of Austin. So this is really -- as you can tell, this is very much sort of autonomy is the story. Like we need the physical product, without which you cannot have autonomy. But once you have a physical product, you need -- the autonomy is what amplifies the value to stratospheric levels. We also launched the Tesla Diner, which has been a huge hit. It actually got worldwide attention, which is unusual for a diner. Diners don't typically get headline news around the earth. But this is a pretty special diner. And if you're in the L.A. area, it's worth visiting. It's sort of a shining beacon of hope in an otherwise sort of bleak open landscape, frankly. So it's really quite a lovely experience. Great job by the Tesla team there. On the full self-driving front, I'll continue talking about that. We have -- we're continuing to make significant improvements just with the software. So we're expecting to increase the parameter count. Actually, at this point, we think we can probably 10x the -- almost 10x the parameter count. Yes, roughly 10x the parameter count. So this is actually a very tricky thing to do because, as you increase the parameter count, you get choked on memory bandwidth. But we currently think we can 10x the parameter count from what people are currently experiencing. So not just 4x, actually 10x increase in parameter count. And yes, so still a lot of improvement on the existing hardware to happen. Energy is growing really well despite headwinds from tariffs and supply chain challenges. The Megapack is expanding capacity quickly, and we have upgrades to the Megapack that will make it even better. And we had record powerwall deployment again in Q2. So I think batteries are just going to be a massive thing. The scale of batteries, battery demand, I think, not that many people appreciate just how gigantic the scale of battery demand is. The way to think about it is that the U.S. sustained power output for the U.S. grid is around 1 terawatt but average usage is less than half a terawatt. If you add batteries to the mix, you can run the power plants 24/7 at full capacity, thus doubling -- more than doubling the energy output per year of the United States just with batteries. But that's again a big deal. It's a really big deal. Optimus, so we're evolving the Optimus design and really getting Optimus to the point where it is a phenomenal design. So we're in Optimus version 2 right now, sort of 2.5. Optimus 3 is an exquisite design, in my opinion, and will be -- as I've said many times before, I predict it will be the biggest product ever. It's a very hard problem to solve. You have to design every part of it from physics first principles. There's nothing that's off the shelf that actually works. So you got to design every motor, gearbox, power electronics, control electronics, sensors, the mechanical elements. We also got to train Optimus to use its limb sensors with a neural net. But we'll be applying the same techniques that we applied for our car, which is essentially a 4-wheel robot. And Optimus is a robot with arms and legs. So put the same principles that apply to optimizing AI inference on the car, apply it to Optimus because they're both really robots in different forms. And Tesla, it is important to note that Tesla is by far the best in the world at real-world AI. Like a clear proof point for that would be -- if you compare, say, Tesla to Waymo, Waymo has got -- the car is festooned with God knows how many sensors. And yet, isn't Google good at AI? Yes, but they're not good at real-world AI. Thus far, they have -- Tesla is actually much better than Google by far and much than anyone at real-world AI. And by far, Tesla has the best inference efficiency. Like I think a key figure of merit for AI is what is the intelligence per gigabyte. And people talk about parameters, blah, blah, blah, but I think we'll -- stop talking about parameters and talk about per gigabytes because with the parameters, you can have 4-bit parameters, 8-bit parameters, 16-bit parameters. But the actual constraints in the hardware are how many gigabytes of RAM and how many gigabytes per second can you transfer from RAM. Therefore, it is not a parameter constraint. It is a byte constraint. And Tesla has the highest intelligence density of any AI by far. And I have a lot of insight into this with xAI. xAI is -- Grok is the smartest AI overall, but it's -- Grok 4 is a giant beast sort of at the terabyte level. And so kind of important to note, Tesla has the best intelligence density. Intelligence density will be a very big deal in the future. It is now. So with Optimus 3, which is really the right design, it's like it doesn't have -- at this point, there's no significant flaws with the Optimus 3 design. But we are going to retool a bunch of things. So there will probably be prototypes of Optimus 3 end of this year and then scale production next year. We're going to try to scale Optimus production as fast as it's humanly possible to do, so we'll try to get to 1 million units a year as quickly as possible. We think we can get there in less than 5 years, it's my sort of -- I guess. That's a reasonable aspiration, 1 million units a year, 5 years, it seems like an achievable target. So in conclusion, so far, 2025 has been a very exciting year, a lot of major milestones. We've made it clear with our demonstrable progress in autonomy that a lot of naysayers said we would not achieve. But it's worth noting that we have done what we said we're going to do. It doesn't mean we're always on time, but we get it done. Now the naysayers are sitting there with an egg on their face. So a great progress by the Tesla team. I do think if Tesla continues to execute well with vehicle autonomy and humanoid robot autonomy, it will be the most valuable company in the world. There's a lot of execution between here and there. It doesn't just happen. But provided we execute very well, I think Tesla has a shot at being the most valuable company in the world. Obviously, I'm extremely optimistic about the future of the company. The best way to predict the future is to make it happen, and we're making it happen here with the Tesla team. So I'd just like to say thanks to all of our supporters. And I think we've got an incredibly exciting future."
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,5,Travis Axelrod,"Great. Thank you very much, Elon. And Vaibhav luck has opening remarks as well."
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,6,Vaibhav Taneja,"Thanks, Travis. As Elon mentioned, Q2 was an interesting quarter in a few respects. We started ramping up the production of the new Model Y at all our factories. We rolled out our robotaxi service in Austin and delivered a car completely autonomously directly from the factory to the customer's home. It is a seminal point to get to this thing. I mean it took a lot of effort, and I really want to thank everybody at Tesla to make this happen. It wasn't an easy thing to do, but we did it. It took time, but we've just begun the next phase for the company. The One Big Bill has a lot of changes that would affect our business in the near term. The first among those changes is the repeal of the IRA EV credit of $7,500 by the end of this quarter. Given the abrupt change, we have limited supply of vehicles in the U.S. this quarter as we have already with the lead times to order parts to build cars. We have rolled out all our planned incentives already and we'll start paring them back as we start to sell. If you are in the U.S. and looking to buy a car, place your order now as we may not be able to guarantee delivery orders placed in the later part of August and beyond. The bill also made changes to certain emission standards by reducing the amount of penalty to zero. This, in turn, will have an impact on the new sales of regulatory credits to other OEMs and, in turn, will lead to lower revenue. While we now plan our business around such sales, it will nonetheless impact our total revenues going forward. On the automotive product portfolio, the entire lineup is updated. Globally, we are seeing an increase in the number of test drives. We started the production of the lower-cost model as planned in the first half of '25. However, given our focus on building and delivering as many vehicles as possible in the U.S. before the EV credit expires and the additional complexity of ramping a new product, the ramp will happen next quarter, slower than initially expected. One thing which is grossly underappreciated, and Elon talked about it, is that all our vehicles in the lineup are capable of autonomy. This is by far the biggest differentiator between us and the competition. Our vehicles' top safety standard has this, but with FSD, they are and will continue to set a new standard for safety within vehicular transportation. We published our vehicle safety report earlier today. And you can see a car on FSD is 10x safer than a car not on FSD. We've started seeing an uptick in FSD adoption in North America in recent months, which is a very promising trend. And just to give you a perspective, since the launch of -- since we moved to version 12 of FSD, we've seen the adoption rates really increase. We've started seeing the -- on the automotive revenue front, despite reduction in regulatory credit revenue, the total automotive revenue increased by 19% sequentially, even though total deliveries only improved 14%. This was primarily due to improved ASPs because of the new Model Y. This helped in improving margins sequentially as well, along with improved mix and higher fixed cost absorption despite an increase in cost from tariffs. We started seeing the impact of tariffs in our P&L. Sequentially, the cost of tariffs increased around $300 million with approximately 2/3 of that impact in automotive and rest in energy. However, given the latency in manufacturing and sales, the full impact will come through in the following quarters, and so costs will increase in the near term. While we are doing our best to manage these impacts, we are in an unpredictable environment on the tariff front. The margins for the energy generation and storage businesses improved sequentially, while deployment reduced primarily due to the ramp of power deployments at higher margins. We were able to achieve our highest gross profit for the business yet. Note that the overall deployments will continue to vary quarter-to-quarter. I think Elon covered this that industrial storage will make a difference in this drive towards AI and data center growth. The energy requirements are increasing at a rapid scale as AI applications are very energy hungry. The quickest path to scale up energy is deploying storage. This is something that our customers have started realizing. And despite this business having the largest impact from tariffs, we are seeing customers willing to accept some of the tariff impacts. The Big Bill has certain adverse impacts even for the energy business, most notably on the residential storage business due to the early expiration of consumer credits by the end of this year. The challenges on the storage business, therefore, remain both from the bill and from the tariffs, and we're doing our best to try and manage through this, but we will see shifts in demand and profitability. The margins for our service and other businesses improved sequentially, primarily due to higher profits from supercharging and improvement in insurance and service center profitability. Operating expenses also grew sequentially as we continued our investment in AI projects, including additional expenses related to employee-related costs, including higher stock-based compensation and depreciation for AI compute. Our operating expenses, especially R&D-related spend, will continue to grow. We believe even in the current environment, it is the right strategy to keep making investments in these areas to position us for the long term. Other income grew sequentially, primarily from the mark-to-market adjustment on Bitcoin holdings, which was a $284 million gain in Q2, while being $125 million loss in Q1. Just want to remind people that this would keep creating volatility based on the Bitcoin price. While operating cash flows increased sequentially, so did our CapEx, resulting in $146 million of free cash flow. We continue to make investments in various aspects of manufacturing like Cybercab, Semi line and other manufacturing spend, and the expansion of our AI initiatives. Our latest expectation for the year in terms of CapEx is in excess of $9 billion. To summarize, we have near-term challenges in our business due to the negative impacts of the bill and tariffs. However, the investments that we have made for AI, robotics and our lead in energy sets us up for a bright future. I would like to thank the whole Tesla team, our customers, our investors and supporters for their continued belief in us."
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,7,Travis Axelrod,"Great. Thank you very much, Vaibhav. So now we're going to move on to say.com questions. The first question is, can you give us some insight how robotaxis have been performing so far? And what rate do you expect to expand in terms of vehicles, geofence, cities and supervisors?"
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,8,Ashok Elluswamy,"Yes. The robotaxi has been doing great so far in Austin. Customers really love the experience. They're like super smooth, very safe and like just a great experience overall. And we already did the first wave of expansion in Austin, and we'll continue to expand in Austin to probably more than 10x our current operating region. We are also testing in a lot of other cities, as Elon mentioned. The next thing to expand would be in the San Francisco Bay Area. We are working with the government to get approval here and, in the meanwhile, launch the service without the person in the driver seat just to expedite and while we wait for regulatory approval. We are also testing a lot of other cities in the U.S., including Florida, Nevada, et cetera."
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,9,Travis Axelrod,"Great. Thank you very much, Ashok. The next question is, what are the key technical and regulatory hurdles still remaining for unsupervised FSD to be available for personal use? Can you provide a time line?"
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,10,Elon R. Musk,We're certainly getting there. I think it will be available for incentivized personal use by the end of this year in certain geographies. We're just being very careful about it.
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,11,Vaibhav Taneja,This is not something which we want to rush. We want to make sure that everything is safe before we make it available broadly.
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,12,Elon R. Musk,"Yes, we're just being extremely primary. But I would be -- I'm confident that by the end of this year, within a number of cities in the U.S., it will be available to end users."
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,13,Ashok Elluswamy,"Yes. And for orders with the same AI hardware in the Austin robotaxi vehicles has still some customer vehicles and we did deliver a car autonomously from the factory to a customer this quarter. And every Tesla manufacturer in the U.S. and in Europe, autonomously drives itself from the end of line to the loading docks. And so it's just a software update."
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,14,Elon R. Musk,"Yes. I think we'll end up delivering cars in the Greater Austin area and the Bay Area by default from the factory by the end of this year. A car will deliver itself to where you are, unless you say you don't want them."
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,15,Ashok Elluswamy,It will be super cool.
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,16,Elon R. Musk,Yes.
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,17,Travis Axelrod,"Great. Thank you, guys. The next question is, what specific factory tasks is Optimus currently performing? And what is the expected time line for scaling production to enable external sales? How does Tesla envision Optimus contributing to revenue in the next 2 to 3 years?"
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,18,Elon R. Musk,"Yes. So the Optimus 3 design, as I mentioned earlier, is, I think, finding the right design. There will be further optimizations, but there are, I think, no fundamental changes that are needed for the Optimus 3 design. It has all the degrees of freedom that you really want or need. So we'll have prototypes of that in, I don't know, 3 months and then start production -- we'll certainly start production on that in the beginning of next year. The production ramp -- it's always difficult to predict the S curve of your production ramp when something has got an entire -- when everything is new because the rate of production will move as fast as the least lucky and least confident element of the entire supply chain as well as internal processes. So the more new stuff that is in a product, the slower the ramp could be because of unexpected supply chain interruptions or mistakes made internally. It's much easier to predict sort of the end of the S-curve or late in the S-curve than the beginning of the S-curve. And the beginning of the S curve of the production ramp is, in any case, not really material for revenue purposes. The beginning of the S-curve, you're usually -- usually, you're always negative gross margin, and you're debugging a lot of issues. So that's why it's -- I feel like fairly confident in predicting things or at least medium confident in predicting where we are in 5 years, but it's hard to predict where we are in a year or 2 years. So that's why I think 5 years, I think we could be at the -- with this ramp, I'd be surprised if at the end of 5 years, 60 months from now -- if we are not roughly making 100,000 Optimus robots a month in 60 months, I would be shocked."
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,19,Travis Axelrod,"All right. Thank you very much. Next question is, can you provide an update on the development and production time line for Tesla's more affordable models? How will these models balance cost reduction and profitability? And what impact do you expect on demand in the current economic climate?"
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,20,Lars Moravy,"Well, I think Vaibhav did a good job of answering this question in his opening remarks. As we said, we started production in June, and we're ramping quality builds and things around the quarter. And given that we started in North America and our goal is to maximize production with a higher rate. So starting Q3, we're going to keep pushing hard on our current models to avoid complexity. Unfortunately, that rolls away, we'll be ready with new, more affordable models available for everyone in Q4. And the goal of those products was not to negatively impact revenue or gross margin, but just to make a car that everyone loves and wants at a more affordable price."
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,21,Travis Axelrod,"Great. Thank you, Lars. The next question is, can you talk about the benefits of Tesla investing in xAI?"
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,22,Vaibhav Taneja,"This is not the forum to discuss this topic. I mean if there is something which we need to discuss, we'll discuss it separately."
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,23,Elon R. Musk,"I think, obviously, we're a publicly traded company. Shareholders are welcome to put forward any shareholder proposals that they'd like. I resolutely encourage that and then have shareholders vote, and we'll act in accordance with the shareholder wishes."
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,24,Travis Axelrod,"Great. Thank you very much. The next question is, can you tell us a little bit more about what goes on in the Tesla design studio?"
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,25,Franz von Holzhausen,
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,26,Chief Designer,"Do you want me to take that one? We kind of generally say that what happens in the studio stays in the studio, and that earnings calls are not the place to disclose new product stuff, but we're working to make sure that we have an exciting future for Tesla and the product lineup."
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,27,Elon R. Musk,"Yes. There's a lot of exciting things happening in the design studio. It's not like static. And really, what's going to happen over the next several years is a fundamental transformation of the company from a pre-autonomy world to a post-autonomy. And I'm working on a new master plan to articulate that to the Tesla team. And there will be -- there are some teething pains as you transition from a pre- autonomy to post-autonomy world. But I think the future vision for Tesla is incredibly exciting and will profoundly change the world in a good way. This may sound like sort of hype or whatever, but I think -- well, let's just say if we execute on that plan effectively, which is you have to actually do that, Tesla will be the most valuable company in the world by far."
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,28,Travis Axelrod,"Great. Thank you. The next question is actually a duplicate on unsupervised FSD for customer vehicles. We'll skip that. After that is, are there any news for Hardware 3 users getting retrofits or upgrades? Will they get Hardware 4 or some future version of Hardware 5?"
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,29,Vaibhav Taneja,"I mean what we want to do is we want to get unsupervised done on Hardware 4 first. Once it's done, then we will go back and look at what we need to do with the Hardware 3 cars. I mean like I said, the focus is first to get unsupervised out, and then we'll go back and see what more work we need to do."
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,30,Travis Axelrod,"Great. Next question is, can you give an update on Dojo? And could xAI be a customer for Dojo?"
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,31,Elon R. Musk,"Dojo 2 -- we expect to have Dojo 2 operating at scale sometime next year, with scale being somewhere around 100,000 H100 equivalents. And then AI5, which is really spectacular, too -- and I don't use those words lightly, spectacular, too. The AI5 chip will hopefully be in volume production around the end of next year. That has a lot of potential. I think -- thinking about Dojo 3 and the AI6 inference chip, it seems like intuitively, we want to try to find convergence there where it's basically the same chip, but it's used where, say, 2 of them in a car or an Optimus and maybe a larger number on a board, kind of 5, 12 on a board or something like that, if you want high-bandwidth communication between the chips, for serving -- doing inference serving. That sort of seems like intuitively the sensible way to go."
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,32,Travis Axelrod,"Great. The next set of questions have all actually been covered. So we'll end with, how will the BBB elimination of tax credits for solar projects affect your sales pipeline for Megapack?"
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,33,Michael Snyder,"Yes. Our sales pipeline is quite diversified across customers and market segments. So we aren't heavily weighted in Megapack projects that are paired with solar. And as we talked about in the opening remarks, we're seeing storage quickly being recognized for its ability to unlock grid efficiency and how quickly it can be deployed to help the grid. Additionally, although the recent bill was not favorable towards solar, we believe solar projects will still get built because the energy is necessary. The projects are well developed and they're ready for execution. And there's really no alternatives in the near term given gas turbine lead times and pricing. We also continue to see growth in the data center segment and in stand-alone storage projects, providing capacity to the grid in several markets across the U.S. Overall, we are forecasting a very strong second half of the year as we increase deployments. And lastly, we continue to invest heavily in U.S. manufacturing to mitigate policy and tariff impacts, expecting our first LFP cell manufacturing facility to be online by the end of the year and launching our third Megafactory near Houston in 2026."
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,34,Travis Axelrod,"Great. Thank you, Mike. We will now be moving to analyst questions. The first question comes from Emmanuel Rosner at Wolfe Research."
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,35,Emmanuel Rosner,Great. Can you hear me?
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,36,Travis Axelrod,Yes.
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,37,Emmanuel Rosner,"So Elon, are you able to share any KPIs with us in terms of the robotaxi business? How many vehicles are you operating, miles driven autonomously or the number of safety critical intervention? Just curious how the rollout generally is going and any sort of like targets that you could share more broadly?"
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,38,Elon R. Musk,"Ashok, do you want to..."
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,39,Ashok Elluswamy,"Yes. We have more than 7,000 miles operating in Austin area. It's just because service is new, we have a handful of vehicles right now, but then we are trying to expand the service in terms of both the area and also the number of vehicles, both in Austin and other locations. So far, there's no notable safety critical incidents. Sometimes we have our own restrictions as to -- for example, we restrict our speed limit to 40 miles per hours. And if the vehicle wants to go on like higher speed roads, we can stop the vehicle, but those are out of convenience as opposed to safety critical nature. So far, the service has been really well received, and we continue to expand on it."
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,40,Emmanuel Rosner,"Yes, longer term, from an economics point of view, longer term, you've previously talked about working to drive down the cost per mile on robotaxis, maybe towards $0.30 or $0.40 per mile over time. Now that your service is live, how should we think about the main milestones to getting there?"
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,41,Elon R. Musk,"Yes. Well, the Cybercab, which is really optimized for autonomy, that, I think, has got probably sub-$0.30 per mile potential over time, maybe $0.25. It's really -- like if you design a car from scratch to be a cost-optimized robotic taxi like Cybercab -- like, for example, we're not trying to make its cornering like incredibly well like a Model 3 would or Model S would or even a Model Y, like it's got -- all of our cars that are driven by people are super fun to drive. They've got incredible acceleration, incredible cornering capability. But we're confident that very few people in a Cybercab want to be hurtling around. So we've produced the top-end speed, which means we can use more efficient tires. We don't need as much acceleration. We don't need as much -- take breaks to sort of -- we want stopping distance, but we're not expecting it to be heavily used. It's a gentle ride. Essentially, if you design it for a gentle ride and then you have a much more optimized design point. So that's why it seems probable we could achieve that. Especially, Optimus is serving, cleaning up the car and doing maintenance and stuff. And doing automatic charging. So I think it's going to -- the actual cost per mile of Cybercab will be very low. The cost per mile of our existing fleet will be higher, but still very competitive. So maybe something over $0.50, I'm just guessing, yes. So really, it tells us robotaxi will go from tiny to gigantic in terms of operations in a pretty short period of time. Like my guess is it has a material impact on our financials around the end of next year."
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,42,Travis Axelrod,Great. Thank you very much. The next question comes from Adam at Morgan Stanley.
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,43,Adam Michael Jonas,"Great. Hello, everybody. So Elon, as Tesla moves into this next phase of physical AI, autonomous humanoids, robotaxis, et cetera, world-changing, civilizational, species-changing technology with dual purpose, are you comfortable moving Tesla in this direction while only having a 13% stake in the economy -- sorry, in the company? Is that sustainable? Or do you still insist that something needs to happen given your current lack of control and the types of technologies you're getting into?"
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,44,Elon R. Musk,"Yes, that is a major concern, as I've mentioned in the past, and I hope that it's addressed at the upcoming shareholders' meeting. But yes, it is a big deal. I don't want to find that I've got like so little control that I can easily be ousted by activist shareholders after having these army of humanoid robots. I think as I've mentioned before, I think my control over Tesla should be enough to ensure that it goes in a good direction, but not so much control that I can't be thrown out if I go crazy."
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,45,Adam Michael Jonas,"Okay. Elon, you're not going to go crazy. We trust you. You can stay a little crazy. A little crazy is okay. Elon, now we understand the Board of Directors of a major U.S. investment bank recently toured Optimus production. I don't know if you want to confirm that or not. It's just what we've heard. That's cool. But when do you think others will be able to get a firsthand view of Optimus like that? And is the second half of this year too soon to have an AI Day? Because it seems like everybody else in the world is doing it and this talent war is getting freaking crazy. And I know you mentioned, for recruiting purposes, this is a very important thing that you've done. I think people have copied you on this. And I'm wondering if this year is too early for that."
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,46,Elon R. Musk,"Yes. It's a bit of a tough thing because like when we do an AI Day, we find that some of our competitors have literally done a frame- by-frame examination of our slides and everything we say and then copy us. So not to say like, well, where's the trade-off, which it does help with recruiting, but then competitors look very closely and copy us. I mean that said, we should probably -- I mean, I guess we could consider the shareholder meeting to be sort of -- we can maybe go into depth, some amount of depth at the Annual Shareholder Meeting with respect to Optimus and AI and sort of our chip stuff perhaps. Yes. Tesla is also really underrated in terms of AI chip design as well as AI software. So like there's still not a chip that exists that we would prefer to put in our car, that is, an AI chip that we would prefer to put in the car over our own, even though it's been now out for several years. And we're confident that the AI5 chip will be a profound game changer. In fact, it's so powerful that we'll have to nerf it, to some degree, for markets outside of the U.S. because it flows way past the export restrictions. So unless the export restrictions change, we actually will have to nerf our AI5 chip, which is kind of weird. Hopefully, we keep raising the bar on export restrictions. Otherwise, it gets a bit [ soggy ]. We'll have a bunch of Optimus robots onstage at the shareholder meeting. The Optimus lab is cool to see. It looks like -- it basically looks like the set of Westworld. We get robots in various stages, some of them are in various stages of repair. I don't know, some combination of like the tattooing junkyard and Westworld sort of thing. It's very cool. And Optimus is walking around the office here in Palo Alto. So 24/7, it's just walking around like some old -- and so we feel optimistic that Tesla Diner is selling popcorn. Yes. So we'll go from a world where robots are rare to where they're so common that you don't even look up."
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,47,Travis Axelrod,"The next question comes from Edison at Deutsche Bank. All right. While Edison figures that out, we will go to the next question, which is going to come from Dan Levy at Barclays."
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,48,Dan Meir Levy,"Elon, you've talked about the opportunity to put non-Tesla-owned vehicles into the robotaxi network. Can you just talk about the gating factors to enabling that and what time line we should expect on personally owned vehicles in the robotaxi network?"
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,49,Elon R. Musk,"We haven't really thought hard about that, but we need to make sure it works when the vehicles are fully under our control. And it's kind of one step at a time here. We don't want to jump the gun. As I said, we're being paranoid about safety. So it's like -- but I guess like next year, I'd say confidently next year, I'm not sure when next year, but confidently next year, people would be able to add or subtract their car to the Tesla fleet."
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,50,Vaibhav Taneja,"I mean one thing to keep in mind is that we will have some criteria because like even when you put your car in an Uber or a Lyft fleet, they go through a whole checklist process of making sure things are working."
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,51,Elon R. Musk,Just like an Airbnb.
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,52,Vaibhav Taneja,Yes. So we will do something like that.
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,53,Elon R. Musk,Kind of bidding process.
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,54,Vaibhav Taneja,"Yes. Because we want -- like Elon said, we want to be paranoid about security. I mean assets, along things like tread on the tire, can have an impact on safety. So that's why we would want to do some proper validation before we let other cars come in."
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,55,Travis Axelrod,"Dan, do you have a follow-up?"
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,56,Dan Meir Levy,"Yes. Could you just unpack the different costs associated with scaling the robotaxi business and how you think about funding those costs? Are the cash flows in the auto business sufficient to fund it? And if not, what other funding sources do you think you'd use? Would you just fund it off the balance sheet?"
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,57,Elon R. Musk,"Well, as soon as there is a clear cash flow stream associated with any product, you can debt finance it."
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,58,Dan Meir Levy,And in the interim?
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,59,Vaibhav Taneja,"In the interim, we will use our balance sheet. But like once we get to a certain scale in terms of recurring revenues, like Elon said, we could get into a -- easily have this kind of transaction to try and get funding."
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,60,Travis Axelrod,Great. We will now move on to Mark from Goldman Sachs.
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,61,Mark Trevor Delaney,"With the FSD trials that Tesla has been offering to consumers and the attention on self-driving more generally, are you able to comment more specifically on what you're seeing with FSD subscription trends and take rates and help us better understand how large FSD revenue may be currently?"
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,62,Vaibhav Taneja,"So we've definitely -- I mentioned it in my opening remarks, since we have launched version 12 of FSD in North America, we've definitely seen a marked improvement in the FSD adoption. And the other thing which we had also done last year is we did bring down the pricing and we've made subscription much more affordable. So we have seen a 25% increase since that time, which is an encouraging trend. But honestly, we've just started the story around explaining the benefits of FSD. Like I said before, we released our vehicle safety report. Even if you don't believe in anything else, a car on FSD being 10x safer should be a motivator. Plus the other thing is people don't realize, even at $99 a month, it's like you're getting a personal chauffeur for almost $3.33 a day. And this is by far the biggest game changer, which I know we've been talking about it because part of it is we live and breathe it, but I think..."
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,63,Elon R. Musk,"Most people still don't know. The vast majority of people don't know it exists. And it's still like half of Tesla owners who could use it haven't tried it even once. They don't actually. And obviously, this is something we want to educate them on. So we've got to -- when they come in for service, we'll reach out to them, send them like videos of how to make it work. It's such a shocking thing. They don't think a car is capable of this. So you have to actually show them and get them comfortable with turning it on and off. It's so trivial. It's like saying you've got a cat that can sing and dance, but it just looks like an old cat. And you're like until you see the cat sing and dance and talk, like you assume it's just a cat. That's Tesla FSD. Our car is intelligent."
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,64,Vaibhav Taneja,"And so what we are going to do, to Elon's point, like we've been giving people free time to try FSD, but we'll start giving more prompts to say, okay, this particular drive try FSD. So that -- I mean, because it's literally seeing is believing. Like Elon said, think of it like a cat. It looks like a normal cat, but this cat can sing and dance. Same thing on FSD, too."
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,65,Travis Axelrod,"Great. And the 25% comment was 25% increase in the penetration rate since we've seen the release of V12 and V13 in North America. Great. Mark, did you have a follow-up question?"
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,66,Mark Trevor Delaney,Yes. Tesla has historically said it would use pricing as one tool to help drive auto vehicle growth as long as free cash flow stayed positive given the ability to monetize products like FSD. I'm curious how you're thinking about pricing from here as a potential tool to drive increased volumes given where you stand with FSD as well as the fact that the IRA purchase tax credits are poised to go away in the U.S. starting in the fourth quarter. So should we expect more meaningful price reductions given that monetization potential? Or do you envision price reductions being more limited compared to cost downs given where free cash flow now stands?
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,67,Elon R. Musk,"Well, we're in this like weird transition period where we will lose a lot of incentives in the U.S. We have incentives actually in many other parts of the world, but we'll lose some in the U.S. Look, we're still a bit at the relatively early stages of autonomy. On the other hand, autonomy is most advanced and most available from a regulatory standpoint in the U.S. So I mean, does that mean like we could have a few rough quarters? Yes, we probably could have a few rough quarters. And I'm not saying we will, but we could, Q4, Q1, maybe Q2. But once you get to autonomy at scale in the second half of next year, certainly by the end of next year, I think I would be surprised if Tesla's economics are not very compelling."
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,68,Travis Axelrod,Great. The next question is going to come from Will from Truist.
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,69,William Stein,"First, I'd like to ask for a little bit more detail about the lower cost model that you talked about having, I think, started production in the first half, but you said will ramp later. At the last Analyst Day, as I recall, you talked about some aspects of this, like 2/3 or 3/4 reduction in silicon carbide and not using rare earths in the motor and perhaps other cost downs. You also had this unboxed architecture that I think you said would not be part of this sort of interim approach. Can you update us on what we should expect this thing to actually look like?"
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,70,Vaibhav Taneja,"Well, we won't get into the looks because..."
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,71,Elon R. Musk,"Let's just get the model out, yes, with the cat out of the bag there, a dancing cat that can sing and dance. But we can talk and say it now, but that's the cool part. Yes. I mean, fundamentally, the biggest obstacle remains that people just don't have -- some people don't -- the desire to buy the car is very high. Just people don't have enough money in their bank account to buy it, literally, that is the issue, not a lack of desire, but a lack of ability. So the more affordable we can make the car, the better. I think it's going to be -- it will be a very big deal when people can release their car to the fleet and have it earn money for them, which like I said, I think I feel confident in saying that will happen next year in the U.S. at least. In the U.S., we're legally allowed, appropriate disclaimers. And that will make the affordability dramatically greater. Just like if you have an Airbnb and you rent out your home when you're not there or rent out a guestroom or a guesthouse, something like that, the affordability of your home is much greater."
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,72,William Stein,"Okay. Trying another topic then. We see all these wonderful developments at xAI like Grok, and obviously, Tesla is trying to do quite a bit in AI. Elon, how do you manage the division of efforts and recruiting and talent and capital between these 2 that seem like there's a very high potential that they could, in fact, compete?"
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,73,Elon R. Musk,"Well, they are doing different things here. So xAI is doing like terabyte-scale models and multi-terabyte-scale models. Tesla is 100x smaller models. So one is real-world AI and one is kind of, I guess, artificial superintelligence type of thing. I mean, really kind of the genesis for xAI was that there were certain people who simply would not join Tesla AI engineers because they wanted to work on ASI, and they would join Tesla. And I was like, ""Well, maybe they'll join a new company."" I think the Tesla problem is extremely important, but not everyone agrees with me on that. And so rather than have them join OpenAI or Google or some other company, it's like might as well have them create a company in that regard, which is xAI, so that's -- and particularly make a decision, do they want to work on like superintelligence data center or real-world AI. They're both compelling problems, but some people want to work on one and some want to work on the other."
3baf804c5a555aee9a259a6769b9b422,74,Travis Axelrod,"Great. And unfortunately, that is all the time we have today. Thank you, everyone, so much for your questions, and we will see you next quarter."
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,1,Travis Axelrod,"Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's third quarter 2025 Q&A Webcast. My name is Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations. I am joined today by Elon Musk, Vaibhav Taneja, and a number of other executives. Our Q3 results were announced at about 3 PM Central Time in the Update deck we published at the same link as this webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. We urge shareholders to read our definitive proxy statement, which contains important information about the matters we voted on at the 2025 annual meeting. During the question and answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue. Before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?"
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,2,Elon Musk,"Thank you. We are at a critical inflection point for Tesla and our strategy going forward as we bring AI into the real world. I think it's important to emphasize that Tesla really is the leader in real-world AI. No one can do what we can do with real-world AI. I have pretty good insight into AI in general. I think that Tesla has the highest intelligence density of any AI out there in the car. And that is only going to get better. We are really just at the beginning of scaling at a quite massive level, full self-driving and robotaxi, and fundamentally changing the nature of transport. I think people just do not quite appreciate the degree to which this will take off. It's honestly going to be like a shock wave. So it's because the cars are all out there. We have millions of cars out there that, with a software update, become full self-driving cars. We are making a couple of million a year. In fact, with the advent of what we see now as clarity on achieving full self-driving, unsupervised full self-driving, I should say, I feel confident in expanding Tesla's production. So that is our intent, to expand as quickly as we can our future production. I was ready to do that until we had clarity on achieving unsupervised full self-driving. But at this point, I feel like we've got clarity, and it makes sense to expand production as fast as we reasonably can. We are also making a huge impact on the energy sector with battery storage. With both Powerwall and especially with the Megapack, we are dramatically improving the ability to generate more energy from the grid. Let me sort of talk a little bit about that, which is if you look at total US energy capability, for example, there's roughly a terawatt of continuous power available in the US. But the average usage over a twenty-four-hour cycle is only half a terawatt because of the big difference between day and night usage. If you buffer the energy with batteries, you can effectively double the energy output in the United States just with batteries, pulling no incremental power plants. It's very difficult to build power plants. They take a long time. There's a lot of permitting. It's not an industry that's used to moving fast. We see the potential there for Tesla battery packs to greatly improve the energy output per year for any given grid, US or otherwise. We are also on the cusp of something really tremendous with Optimus, which I think is likely to be, has the potential to be, the biggest product of all time. It's a difficult project. It's worth noting that it's not just automatic. I'm unaware of any robot program by Ford or GM or, you know, in the by USC of car companies. People might think of Tesla as a car company that mostly makes cars and battery packs. It's not just an obvious fall of a log thing to make Optimus, but we do have the ingredients of real-world AI and exceptional electrical mechanical engineering capabilities and the ability to scale production, which I don't think anyone else has all of those ingredients. With version 14 of self-driving, people can see the reactions of people online. They're quite amazed. Actually, anyone in the US can get version 14 if they just go and select ""I want the advanced software"" in their car. If you're listening right now and you'd like to try it out, just go into settings and say, ""I want the advanced software,"" and you will get version 14. On the Megapack front, we unveiled Megablock, Mega Pack three. We also have exciting plans for MegaPack four. MegaPack four will incorporate a lot of what is normally in a substation and be able to output at probably 35 kilovolts directly. This greatly improves our ability to deploy Megapack because it's not dependent on building a substation up through 35 KB for MegaPack four. That's the engineering priority for Megapack. We look forward to unveiling Optimus b three probably in Q1. I think it'll be ready to show off. That, I think, is going to be quite remarkable. It won't even seem like a robot. It'll seem like a person in a robot suit, which is kind of how we started off with Optimus. It'll seem so real that you'll need to poke it, I think, to believe that it's actually a robot. Obviously, the real-world intelligence we've developed for the car, most of that transfers to Optimus. It's a very good starting point. In conclusion, we're excited about the updated mission of Tesla, which is sustainable abundance. Going beyond sustainable energy to say, sustainable abundance is the mission, where we believe with Optimus and self-driving, we can actually create a world where there is no poverty, where everyone has access to the finest medical care. Optimus will be an incredible surgeon, for example. Imagine if everyone had access to an incredible surgeon. Of course, we make sure Optimus is safe and everything, but I do think we're headed for a world of sustainable abundance. I'm excited to work with the Tesla team to make that happen."
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,3,Travis Axelrod,"Great. Thank you very much, Elon. Vaibhav also has some opening remarks."
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,4,Vaibhav Taneja,"Thanks, Travis. Q3 was a special quarter at multiple levels. We set new records not just for deliveries and deployments, but also around a range of financial metrics from total revenues, energy gross profit, energy margins to fresh free cash flow. This was the result of continued confidence of our customers in our products and the relentless efforts of the Tesla team. The strength in deliveries was attributed to strong performance across all regions. Greater China and APAC were up sequentially 33%, North America was up 28%, while EMEA was up 25%. The pace in deliveries was the function of continued excitement around the new Model Y. I had previously talked about 2025 being the year of the Y, and we have since delivered on that promise. Model Y was released in Q1, followed by Model Y long wheelbase and performance, and more recently, Standard Y in North America and EMEA. We are now operating a robotaxi in two markets, Austin and most various cities. We have already expanded our coverage area in Austin three times since the initial launch and are on pace to continue expanding further. Unlike our competitors, our robotaxi fleet blends in the markets we operate in since they don't have extra sensor sets or peripherals which make them stick out. This is an underappreciated aspect of our current vehicle offerings, which are all designed for autonomous driving. We feel that as people experience the supervised FSD at scale, demand for our vehicles, like Elon said, would increase significantly. On the FSD adoption front, we've continued to see decent progress. However, note that the total paid FSD customer base is still small, around 12% of our current fleet. We are working with regulators in places like China and EMEA to obtain approvals so that we can deploy FSD in those regions as well. Now covering a little bit on the financial side, automotive revenues increased 29% in line with the growth in deliveries. While regulatory credits declined sequentially, we entered into new contracts and continued delivery on previously entered contracts. Our automotive margins, excluding credits, increased marginally from 15% to 15.4%. This was attributed to improvements in material cost and better fixed cost absorption due to higher volumes. The energy storage business continued to deliver with record deployments, gross profit, and margins. As discussed before, this business has a bigger impact from tariffs, as measured by percentage of COGS since currently all sales procured are from China while we're still working on other alternatives. However, as the ramp of mega factory Shanghai is happening, this is helping us avoid tariffs. We are using this factory to supply the non-US demand. Like Elon said, grid-scale storage is the only way we can get to electricity fastest by using storage. The other thing to keep in mind is we are seeing headwinds in this business given the increase in competition and tariffs. The total tariff impacts for Q3 for both businesses were in excess of $400 million, generally split evenly between them. Services and other demonstrated a marked improvement sequentially. This was a function of improvements primarily in our insurance and service center businesses. Note that while small, our robotaxi costs are included within services and other along with our other businesses like paid supercharging, used car, parts and merchandise sales, etc. Our operating expenses increased sequentially. The largest increase included in restructuring and other related to certain actions undertaken to reduce cost and improve efficiency to convergence of our AR AI chip design efforts. Additionally, we incurred legal expenses related to proceedings in certain legal cases. As incremental cost incurred preparation for our shareholder meeting. Such costs are recorded within SG&A. Further, our employee-related spend is increasing, especially in R&D. We have recently granted various performance-based equity awards to employees working on AI initiatives. Therefore, such spend will continue to increase forward. On other income, our other income decreased sequentially primarily from mark-to-market adjustments on BTC Holdings, which was a much smaller gain of $80 million in Q3 versus $284 million in Q2. With the rest of the movement attributable to FX movements in the quarter. Our free cash flow for the quarter was approximately $4 billion, which was yet another record. Our total cash and investments at the end of the quarter were over $41 billion. On the CapEx front, while we are expecting to be around $9 billion for the current year, we're projecting the numbers to increase substantially in 2026 as we prepare the company for the next phase of growth in terms of not just our existing businesses, but our bets around AI initiatives, including Optimus. In conclusion, note that bringing AI into the real world is hard. But we have never shied away from doing what is hard. We are extremely excited about the future and are laying down the foundation, the benefits of which will be realized over years to come. I would like to end by thanking the Tesla team, our customers, our investors, and supporters for the continued belief in us. Thank you very much, Vibhav. Now let's go to investor questions."
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,5,Travis Axelrod,"From say.com, the first question is, what are the latest robo taxi metrics fleet size, cumulative miles, rides completed, intervention rates, when will safety drivers be removed? What are the obstacles still preventing unsupervised FSD from being deployed to customer vehicles?"
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,6,Elon Musk,"I'll start off with that, and then Ashok can elaborate. We are expecting to have no safety drivers in at least large parts of Austin by the end of this year. So within a few months, we expect to have no safety drivers at all in at least parts of Austin. We're obviously being very cautious about the deployment. Our goal is to be actually paranoid about deployment because, obviously, even one accident will be front-page headline news worldwide. It's better for us to take a cautious approach here. But we do expect to have no safety drivers in the car in Austin within a few months. I think that's perhaps the most important data point. We do expect to be operating robotaxi in, I think, about eight to ten metro areas by the end of the year. It depends on various regulatory approvals. You can actually think most of our regulatory applications are online. You can kind of see them because they're public information. We expect to be operating in Nevada, Florida, and Arizona by the end of the year. Ashok?"
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,7,Ashok Elluswamy,"Yeah. We continue to operate our fleet in Austin without anyone in the driver's seat, and we have covered more than a quarter million miles with that. In the Bay Area, we still have a person in the driver's seat due to the regulations, and we've crossed more than a million miles. We continue to see that the robotaxi fleet works really well. Customers are really happy, and there are no notable issues. On the customer side, we have FSD supervised for a total of 6 billion miles as of yesterday. That's a big milestone. Overall, the safety continues to be very good. As Elon mentioned, we are on track to remove the person from inside the car altogether, starting with Austin."
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,8,Travis Axelrod,"Great. The next question is, what is the demand and backlog for Megapack, Powerwall, solar, or energy storage systems? With the current AI boom, is Tesla planning to supply power to other hyperscalers?"
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,9,Elon Musk,Thanks.
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,10,Michael Snyder,"Demand for Megapack and Powerwall continues to be really strong into next year. We received very strong positive customer feedback on our Mega Block product, which will begin shipping next year out of Houston. We're seeing remarkable growth in the demand for AI and data center applications as hyperscalers and utilities have seen the versatility of the Megapack product. It increases reliability and relieves grid constraints, as Elon was talking about. We've also seen a surge in residential solar demand in the US due to policy changes, which we expect to continue into 2026 as we introduce the new solar lease product. We also began production of our Tesla residential solar panel in our Buffalo factory, and we will be shipping that to customers starting Q1. The panel has industry-leading aesthetics and shape performance and demonstrates our continued commitment to US manufacturing."
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,11,Travis Axelrod,"Great. Thank you, Mike. Unfortunately, the next question is related to future products. This is not the appropriate venue to cover that, so we're going to have to skip it. The question after that is, what are the present challenges in bringing Optimus to market considering app control software engineering hardware, training general mobility models, training task-specific models, training voice models, implementing manufacturing, and establishing supply chains?"
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,12,Elon Musk,"Yeah. I mean, bringing Optimus to market is an incredibly difficult task, to be clear. It's not like some walk in the park. At some point, I mean, actually, technically, Optimus can walk in the park right now. We do have Optimus robots that walk around our offices at our engineering headquarters in Palo Alto, California, basically twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Any visitors that come by can actually stop one of the Optimus robots and ask it to take them somewhere, and it'll literally take them to that meeting room or that location in the building. I don't want to downplay the difficulty, but it's an incredibly difficult thing, especially to create a hand that is as dexterous and capable as the human hand, which is incredible. The human hand is an incredible thing. The more you study the human hand, the more incredible you realize it is, and why you need four fingers and a thumb, why the fingers have certain degrees of freedom, why the various muscles are of different strengths, and fingers are of different lengths. It turns out that those are all there for a reason. Making the hand and forearm, because most of the actuators, just like the human hand, the muscles that control your hand are actually primarily in your forearm. The Optimus hand and forearm is an incredibly difficult engineering challenge. I'd say it's more difficult than the rest of the robot from an electromechanical standpoint. The forearm and hand are more difficult than the entire rest of the robot. But really, in order to have a useful generalized robot, you do need an incredible hand. Then you need the real-world AI, and you need to be able to scale up that production to have it be relevant because it's not relevant if it's just a few hundred robots. You need to be able to make Optimus robots at volumes comparable to vehicles, not significantly higher. So trying to make a million Optimus robots per year, that manufacturing challenge is immense considering that the supply chain doesn't exist. With cars, you've got an existing supply chain. With computers, you've got an existing supply chain. With a humanoid robot, there is no supply chain. In order to manufacture that, Tesla actually has to be very vertically integrated and manufacture very deep into the supply chain, manufacture the parts internally because there just is no supply chain. This is the kind of thing where I'm like, if I put myself in the position of a startup trying to make a humanoid robot, I'm like, I don't know how to do it without an immense amount of manufacturing technology. That's why I think Tesla is in almost a unique position when you consider manufacturing technology, scaling real-world AI, and a truly dexterous hand. Those are generally the things that are missing when you read about other robots that just don't have those three things. I think we can achieve all those things with an immense amount of work, and that is the game plan. My fundamental concern with regard to how much voting control I have at Tesla is if I go ahead and build this enormous robot army, can I just be ousted at some point in the future? That's my biggest concern. That is really the only thing I'm trying to address with this. It's called compensation, but it's not like I'm going to go spend the money. It's just, if we build this robot army, do I have at least a strong influence over that robot army, not current control, but a strong influence? That's what it comes down to in a nutshell. I don't feel comfortable wielding that robot army if I don't have at least a strong influence."
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,13,Ashok Elluswamy,Great. Thank you.
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,14,Travis Axelrod,"We've already covered robotaxi expansion. Unfortunately, the question after that is another future product question, so we're going to have to skip that. The next one, though, is can you update us on the $16.5 billion Samsung chip deal in Taylor? The importance of semiconductors to autonomy in Tesla's AI-driven future, what gives you confidence Samsung can fulfill AI six at Tesla's timelines? And achieve relatively better yields and cost versus TSMC."
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,15,Elon Musk,"Okay. I'm going to give quite a long answer to this question because I have to unpack this question and then answer the unpacked version. First of all, I have nothing but great things to say about Samsung. They're an amazing company. Samsung, it's worth noting, does manufacture our AI four computer and does a great job doing that. Now with the AI five, and here's where I need to make a point of clarification relative to some comments I've made publicly before, which is we're actually going to focus both TSMC and Samsung initially on AI five. The AI five chip designed by Tesla is, I think, an amazing design. I've spent almost every weekend for the last few months with the chip design team working on AI five. I don't hand out praise easily, but I have to say that I think the TensorFlow team is really an incredible chip here. By some metrics, the AI five chip will be 40 times better than the AI four chip. Not 40%, 40 times. Because we have a detailed understanding of the entire software and hardware stack, we're designing the hardware to address all of the pain points in software. I don't think there's really anyone that's doing this thing the entire stack all the way through real-world. You know, calibrating against the real world where you've got cars and robots in the real world, we know what the chip needs to do, and we know just as importantly, we know what the chip doesn't need to do. To sort of use some examples here, with the AI five, we deleted the legacy GPU or the traditional GPU, which is in AI four. But AI five does not have, we just deleted the legacy GPU because it basically is a GPU. We also deleted the image signal processor. This looks like a long list of deletions that are very important. As a result of these deletions, we can actually fit AI five in a half reticle and with good margin for traces from the memory to the Tesla accelerators, the ARM CPU cores, and the PCI blocks. This is a beautiful chip. I've poured so much life energy into this chip personally, and I'm confident this is going to be a winner. Next level. It makes sense to have both Samsung and TSMC focus on AI five. Even though technically, Samsung fab has slightly more advanced equipment than the TSMC fab. These will both be made in the US, one TSMC in Arizona, Samsung in Texas. We're going to make starting off just to be confident. Our explicit goal is to have an oversupply of AI five chips. If we have too many AI five chips for the cars and robots, we can always put them in the data center. We already use AI four for training in our data center. We use a combination of AI four and NVIDIA hardware. We're not about to replace NVIDIA, to be clear, but we do use both in combination. AI four and NVIDIA hardware, and the AI five excess production can always be put in our data centers. NVIDIA keeps improving. The challenge that they have is that they've got to satisfy a large range of requirements from a lot of customers. Tesla only has to satisfy requirements from one customer, Tesla. That makes the design job radically easier and means we can delete a lot of complexity from the chip. I can't emphasize how important this is. When you look at the various logic blocks in the chip, you increase the number of logic blocks, you also increase the interconnections between the logic blocks. If you can think of it like there are highways, like how many highways do you need to connect the various parts of the chip? Especially if you're not sure how much data is going to go between each logic block on the chip, then you kind of end up having giant highways going all over the place. It's a very, it becomes almost an impossibly difficult design problem, and NVIDIA has done an amazing job of dealing with almost an impossibly difficult set of requirements. But in our case, we're going for radical simplicity. The net effect is that I think AI five will be the best performance per watt, maybe by a factor of two or three, and best performance per dollar for AI, maybe by a factor of 10. We'll have to, the proof's in the pudding, so obviously, we need to actually get this chip made and made at scale. But that's what it looks like."
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,16,Travis Axelrod,"Great. Thank you, Elon. We've already covered unsupervised FSD. So the next question is, instead of trying to replace hardware three with hardware four, why not give an equal incentive to trade in for a new vehicle?"
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,17,Vaibhav Taneja,"Yeah. We've not completely given up on hardware three. However, over the last year, we've offered the customers the option to transfer FSD to their new vehicle. At times, we've been running some promotions. If they've got FSD, they can get better preferential rates. We've been taking care of this. We do want to solve autonomy first. Then we'll come back with a way to take care of these customers. These customers are very important. They were the early adopters. For what it's worth, my daily commuter is a hardware three car, which I use FSD on a daily basis. We will definitely take care of you guys."
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,18,Ashok Elluswamy,"Once the v 14 release series is fully done, we are planning on working on a v 14 Lite version for hardware three. Probably expected in Q2 next year."
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,19,Travis Axelrod,"Awesome. Thanks, Ashok. Alrighty. Our final question from Se is, how long until we see self-driving Tesla Semi trucks? And could you see this technology replacing trains?"
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,20,Elon Musk,"Yeah. So I guess I'll start with that in terms of the semi,"
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,21,Lars Moravy,"production plan and schedule. The factory is going on schedule. We've completed the building and are installing the equipment now. We've got our fleet of validation trucks driving on the road. We'll have a larger build towards the end of this year and then our first online builds in the first part of next year, ramping into the Q2 timing with real volume coming in the back half of the year. That's going quite well, and that's the first step to obviously getting autonomous trucks on the road. In terms of trains, they're really great for long point-to-point deliveries. They're super efficient, but that last mile, the load-unload can be better served for shorter distances with autonomous semis, and that would be great. We do expect that to probably shift in as we, as Elon said, change the way transportation is considered. We're looking forward to that timeline. Ashok, I know you can take the full self-driving part."
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,22,Ashok Elluswamy,"Currently, the team is super focused on solving for passenger vehicles autonomy. That said, the same technology will apply quite easily to the semi truck once we have a little bit of data from the semi trucks."
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,23,Travis Axelrod,"Great. And now we will move over to analyst questions. The first question comes from Emmanuel, at Wolfe. Emmanuel, please go ahead and unmute yourself."
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,24,Emmanuel Rosner,"Great. Thanks so much. Hi, everybody. So Elon, you talked about expanding production of vehicles as fast as possible now that you have confidence in the unsupervised autonomy. How should we think about that in the context of your existing capacity of 3 million units? Is that where you're hoping to get volume to? What sort of timeline are we talking about? And would this require some level of boosting or incentivizing demand? Like would this basically be prioritizing volume over near-term profitability given the longer-term opportunity?"
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,25,Elon Musk,"Well, capacity isn't quite 3 million. But it will be 3 million at some point. Aspirationally, it could be 3 million within, we could probably hit an annualized rate of 3 million within twenty-four months, I think. Maybe less than twenty-four months. Bear in mind, there's an entire supply chain, a vast supply chain that's got to also move in tandem with that. I think we're going to expand production as fast as we can and as fast as our suppliers can keep up with it. Then we're going to think about where we build incremental factories beyond that. The single biggest expansion in production will be the Cyber Cap, which starts production in Q2 next year. That's really a vehicle that's optimized for full autonomy. It, in fact, does not have a steering wheel or pedals and is really an enduring optimization on minimizing cost per mile for fully considered cost per mile of operation. For our other vehicles, they still have a little bit of the horse carriage thing going on where, obviously, if you've got steering wheels and pedals and you're designing a car that people might want to go very direct past acceleration and tight cornering, like high-performance cars, then you're going to design a different car than one that is optimized for a comfortable ride and doesn't expect to go past sort of 85 or 90 miles an hour. It's just aiming for a gentle ride the whole time. That's what Cyber Cap is. Do I think we'll sacrifice margins? I don't think so. I think the demand will be pretty nutty. Here's the killer app, really. What it comes down to is, can you text while you're in the car? If you tell someone, yes, the car is now so good, you can be on your phone and text the entire time while you're in the car, anyone who can buy the car will buy the car. End of story. That's what everybody wants to do. In fact, not everyone wants to. They do do that. That's why, in fact, the reason you've seen an uptick in accidents, pretty much worldwide, is because people are texting and driving. Autopilot actually dramatically improves the safety here. If someone's looking down at their phone, they're not driving very well. That's really the game changer. At this point, I feel essentially 100% confident, I say not essentially, 100% confident that we can solve unsupervised full self-driving at a safety level much greater than human. We've released 14.1, got a technology roadmap that's, I think, pretty amazing. We'll be adding reasoning to the car. Our world simulator for reinforcement learning is pretty incredible. Our Tesla reality simulator, when you see it, the video that's generated by the Tesla reality simulator and the actual video looks exactly the same. That allows us to have a very powerful reinforcement learning loop to further improve the Tesla AI. We're going to be increasing the parameter count by an order of magnitude. That's not in 14.1. There are also a number of other improvements to the AI that are quite radical. This car will feel like it is a living creature. That's how good the AI will get with the AI four computer before AI five. AI five, like I said, is by some metrics forty times better. But just to say safely, it's a 10x improvement. It might almost be too much intelligence for a car. I do wonder, like, how much intelligence should you have in a car? It might get bored. One of the things I thought of, like, well, if we've got all these cars that maybe are bored, well, why they're sort of, if they are bored, we could actually have a giant distributed inference fleet. If they're not actively driving, just have a giant distributed inference fleet. At some point, if you've got tens of millions of cars in the fleet, or maybe at some point 100 million cars in the fleet, and let's say they had, at that point, I don't know, a kilowatt of inference capability of high-performance inference capability, that's 100 gigawatts of inference distributed with power and cooling taken with cooling and power conversion taken care of. That seems like a pretty significant asset."
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,26,Travis Axelrod,"Great. Thanks, Elon. The next question comes from Adam from Morgan Stanley. Adam, please feel free to unmute yourself. Adam, go ahead and ask your question. Seems like we might be having some audio issues with Adam, so we'll come back to you. Next question will then come from Dan, from Barclays."
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,27,Dan Meir Levy,"Hi. Good evening. Thank you for taking the question. Elon, I know that Tesla's really focused on with master plan for bringing AI into the physical world. I think we've seen over the past, you know, this willingness for Tesla to engage and go into new markets, new TAMs. So when you think about the growth prospects, how do we define the areas that are really within Tesla's core competency versus where do you draw the line for markets or AI applications that are outside of Tesla's core competency?"
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,28,Elon Musk,"Actually, I'm not sure what you mean by AI applications outside of Tesla's core competency. We kind of didn't have any of these core competencies when we started, you know. We had zero core competencies, total competency of zero, actually. You can think of Tesla as, like, I don't know, a dozen startups in one company. I've initiated every one of those startups. We didn't used to make battery packs, stationary battery packs, but now we do. We make them for the home, make them for utility scale with Powerwall and Megapack. We created the supercharger network globally. No one else has created a global supercharger network. In fact, the North American supercharger network is so good that basically, yeah, every other manufacturer in North America has converted to our standard and uses the Tesla Supercharger network. If it was so easy, why didn't they just do it? The Chef Design team started that from scratch. The Tesla AI software team was started from scratch. I literally just said, hey, we're going to start this thing. I posted it on Twitter, now X. Join us if you'd like to build it. In fact, Ashok was, I believe, the first person I interviewed for the Tesla autopilot team, which we now call Tesla AI software team because it is the AI software team. Core competencies created while you wait. Optimus at scale is the infinite money glitch. It's difficult to express the magnitude of, like, if you've got something that, like, if Optimus, I think, probably achieves five times the productivity of a person per year because it can operate twenty-four seven. It doesn't even need to charge. It can operate tethered. It's plugged in the whole time. That's why I call it, like, if you're true of sustainable abundance, where working will be optional. There's a limit to how much AI can do in enhancing the productivity of humans. There is not really a limit to AI that is embodied. That's why I called the infinite money glitch."
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,29,Vaibhav Taneja,"I mean, one thing which I'll further add is, I mean, forget, like, our first iteration of autopilot was ten years back. Elon had started this way back in the day. We've got the twist to prove it. Exactly. Even on the Optimus side, as much as people think, oh, good, this is a new thing. Still remember, was it four plus years back? We were in a meeting with Elon, and Elon said, hey, our car is a robot on wheels. That's where we started developing. In fact, most of the engineering team working on Optimus has come from the vehicle side. That's why, you know, when we talk about manufacturing progress, we have the wherewithal because the same engineers who worked back in the day on drive units are working on actuators now. If there is any company which can do it at scale, that is going to be us."
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,30,Elon Musk,"We also have actually added a lot of new engineers as well to the team. A lot of the credit for the Optimus engineering is actually also near new engineers, many of them that are just out of college, actually. The Optimus engineering team is a very talented engineering team. I'd say, like, wow, actually. The Optimus reviews at this point are that there's the engineering review and then there's the manufacturing review. Being done simultaneously. With an iterative loop between engineering design and manufacturing. We design something and we say, like, oh, man, that's really difficult to make. We need to change that design to make it easier to manufacture. We've made radical improvements to the design of Optimus while increasing the functionality, but making it actually possible to manufacture. I'd say Optimus two is almost impossible to manufacture, frankly. But my two-point, we've gone from a person in a robot outfit to what people have seen with Optimus 2.5 where it's doing kung fu. Optimus was at the Tron premiere doing kung fu, just up in the open, with Jared Leto. Nobody was controlling it. It was just doing kung fu with Jared Leto at the Tron Premier. You can see the videos online. The funny thing is, a lot of people walked past it thinking it was just a person. Even though with Optimus 2.5, you can see that it has a waist that's three inches wide. It results in not a human. But the movements were so human-like that a lot of people didn't realize they were looking at a robot. What I'm saying is, Optimus three will be a giant improvement on that. Made at scale, like I said, a very difficult thing. The Optimus engineering and manufacturing reviews and there's the Friday night meeting with Optimus, which sometimes goes till midnight. My Saturday meeting is with the AI chip design team. Two things are crucial to the future of the company."
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,31,Travis Axelrod,"Great. And Dan, do you have a follow-up?"
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,32,Dan Meir Levy,"Yeah. I think just as a related, maybe you could just talk about to what extent are the AI efforts at Tesla and x AI complementary, or are they just different forms of AI? Maybe you can just distinguish for the audience. Thank you."
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,33,Elon Musk,"Yeah. There are different forms of AI. The XAI, so Grok is like a giant model. You could not possibly squeeze Grok onto a car. That's for sure. It is a giant piece of a model. With Grok, it's trying to solve for artificial general intelligence with a massive amount of AI training compute and inference compute. For example, Grok five will actually only run effectively on a GV 300. That's how much of a beast Grok five is. Whereas Tesla's models are, I don't know, maybe about less than 10% the size, maybe closer to 5% the size of Grok. They're really at the problem from very different angles. XAI and Grok are competing with Google Gemini and OpenAI ChatGPT and that kind of thing. Some of it's complementary. For example, for Grok voice, being able to interact with Grok in the car is cool. Grok for Optimus voice recognition and audio voice generation is Grok, so that's helpful there. But they are coming at it from kind of opposite ends of the spectrum."
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,34,Travis Axelrod,"Alrighty. Adam, let's give it another try. When you're ready, please unmute yourself for the next question. Alrighty. Unfortunately, Adam is having audio issues. So we're going to move on to Walt from LightShed. Walt, please go ahead and unmute yourself."
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,35,Walt,Can you hear me now?
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,36,Travis Axelrod,Yes. Perfect. Thank you.
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,37,Walt,"Just getting back to Austin. If you can remove the safety driver at year-end, is the limitation in the Bay Area just regulatory, or is it kind of the market by market learning process? Similarly, in the eight to ten markets that you mentioned to get added, is the decision there to put a safety attendant in the passenger seat or the safety driver in, is that like your step-by-step process to opening up a market, or is it really just the regulation and the individual market?"
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,38,Elon Musk,"Well, I think even if the regulators weren't making us do it, we'd still do that as the right sort of cautious approach to a new market. Just to make sure that we're being paranoid about safety, I think it makes sense to have a safety driver or safety occupant in the car when we first go to new markets to confirm that there's not something we're missing. All it takes is one in 10,000 trips to go wrong, and you've got an issue. It just makes sure, like, is there some peculiarity about a city, like a very difficult intersection or something that's an unexpected challenge in a city for that one in 10,000 situation. We probably could just let it loose in these cities, but we just don't want to take a chance. What we're talking about here is maybe three months of safety driver in a new metro to confirm that it's good, and then we take the safety driver off, that kind of thing."
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,39,Walt,"Okay. Then on FSD 14, it has a different feel than 13, and it's also, I think, a little different than what it feels like in Austin. Is it basically different development paths that you're doing in terms of the robotaxi stuff versus what you're dropping to the early adopters? When you push these new builds, is it that you're looking for notable improvements in intervention rates, or is that largely solved and it's more about adding the functionality, like the parking, the drive modes, or just the overall comfort?"
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,40,Elon Musk,"The first priority when we release a major new software architecture for Autopilot is safety. It starts off with safety, obviously, safety prioritized, and then solve comfort thereafter. That's why I don't recommend people take the initial version. That's why I say, like, yeah, most people should wait until 14.2 before they actually download version 14. By 14.2, we will have addressed many of the comfort issues. The priority is very much safety first and then thereafter, the comfort issues. That's why most people are like, it'll be safe but jerky. We just need time to smooth the rough edges and solve for comfort in addition to safety with a major new autopilot architecture change. I know what the roadmap is for the Tesla real-world AI in very granular detail. Obviously, Ashok is leading that. I mean, I spend a lot of time with the team going in excruciating detail here on what we're doing to improve the real-world AI. This car is going to feel like it is a living creature. That's with AI four before even AI five."
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,41,Ashok Elluswamy,"Yeah. The roadmap is super exhilarating. We're waiting so much, like, at least all the stuff we are working on. In terms of what we ship to customers versus robotaxi, it's mostly the same. Customers have some more features like, you know, they can choose the car wants to park in a spot or drive you or something like that, which is not super relevant for robotaxi. But there's only a few minor changes like those ones. But the majority of the algorithms and architecture, everything is the same between those two platforms."
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,42,Elon Musk,"Yeah. As I mentioned earlier, we'll be adding reasoning to, I don't know, reasoning in 14.3, maybe 14.4, something like that."
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,43,Ashok Elluswamy,"Yeah. See here. Or by end of this year, for sure."
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,44,Elon Musk,"Yeah. With reasoning, it's literally going to think about which parking spot to pick. It's going to say, this is the entrance, but actually, probably, there's not a parking spot right at the entrance. If it's a full, you know, if the parking lot is fairly full, the probability of an open parking spot right at the entrance is very low. But actually, what it'll simply do is drop you off at the entrance of the store and then go find a parking spot. It's going to get very smart about figuring out a parking spot. It's going to spot empty spots better than a human. It's got 360-degree vision, and it's going to, yeah."
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,45,Ashok Elluswamy,"Yeah. Like I said, it's going to use reasoning to solve things."
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,46,Elon Musk,"Yep. Putting that all inside the computer that has AI four is the actual challenge. That's what the team is working on. Obviously, you can do reasoning on the server that takes forever. But then in the car, you need to make real-time decisions. Putting all the, you know, that's in the car, that's the challenge."
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,47,Elon Musk,"Yeah. That's why I say, like, I have a pretty good understanding of AI, you know, the giant model level with Grok and with Tesla. I'm confident in saying that Tesla has the highest intelligence density. When you look at the intelligence per gigabyte, I think Tesla AI is probably an order of magnitude better than anyone else. It doesn't have any choice because that AI has got to fit in the AI four computer. The discipline of having that level of AI intelligence density will pay great dividends when you go to something that has an order of magnitude more capability like AI five. Now you have that same intelligence density, but you've got 10 times more capability in the computer."
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,48,Travis Axelrod,"Great. The next question will come from Colin at Oppenheimer. Colin, please unmute yourself when you're ready."
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,49,Colin Langan,"Colin, go ahead and unmute yourself, please."
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,50,Colin Langan,"Thanks so much, guys. I appreciate you bringing up the challenges of hand dexterity in humanoids, along with the state of the supply chain and the vertical integration you guys are pursuing. I'm just trying to harmonize the timeline for the start of production next year with the state of the supply chain. What sounds like a fair amount of work remains on the dexterity before you can really freeze the hardware design and start to scale up production."
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,51,Elon Musk,"Well, the hardware design will not actually be frozen even through the start of production. There'll be continued iteration. A bunch of the things that you discover are very difficult to make. You only find that pretty late in the game. We'll be doing rolling changes for the Optimus design even after the start of production. I do think that the new hand is an incredible piece of engineering. We'll actually have a production intent prototype ready to show off in Q1, probably February or March. We're going to be building a million units Optimus production line, hopefully with the production start towards the end of next year. That production ramp will take a while to get to an annualized rate of a million because it's going to move as fast as the slowest, dumbest, least lucky thing out of 10,000 unique items. But it will get to a million units. Ultimately, we'll do Optimus four. That'll be 10 million units. Optimus five, maybe 50 to 100 million units. It's really pretty nutty."
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,52,Travis Axelrod,"Alrighty. That is unfortunately all the time we have for Q&A today. Before we conclude though, Vaibhav has some closing remarks."
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,53,Vaibhav Taneja,"Thanks, Travis. I want to take the time to talk about an extremely important work which is being held on November 6. The meeting will shape the future of Tesla. We are asking you as our shareholders to support Elon's leadership through the two compensation proposals and the reelection of Ira, Kathleen, and Joe to the board. Note that it is a team sport. Here at Tesla, the board is an integral part of the winning team. Shareholders are the center of everything we do at Tesla, and a special committee has laid out a compensation package. Like Elon said, we don't even want to call it a compensation package."
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,54,Elon Musk,"Yeah. It's just like the point is that I just need enough voting control to give a strong influence, but not so much that I can't be fired if I go insane. I think that sort of number is in the mid-twenties approximately. As a company that has already gone public, we've investigated every possible way to achieve voting control without, you know, is there some way to have a supervoting stock, but there really isn't. There is no way to have a supervoting stock after you've gone public. For example, Google, Meta, many other companies have this. But they had it before they went public. It sort of gets, I guess, grandfathered in. Tesla does not have that. Like I said, I just don't feel comfortable building a robot army here and then being ousted because of some asinine recommendations from ISS and Glass Lewis who have no freaking clue. I mean, those guys are corporate terrorists. The problem, yeah. Let me explain, like, the core problem here is that so many of the index funds, passive funds, vote along the lines of whatever Glass Lewis and ISS recommend. They've made many terrible recommendations in the past. If those recommendations had been followed, they would have been extremely destructive to the future of the company. But if you've got passive funds that essentially defer responsibility for the vote to Glass Lewis and ISS, then you can have extremely disastrous consequences for a publicly traded company if too much of the publicly traded company is controlled by index funds. It's de facto controlled by Glass Lewis and ISS. This is a fundamental problem for corporate governance. They're not voting along the lines that are actually good for shareholders. That's the big issue. That's what it comes down to. ISS, Glass Lewis, corporate terrorism."
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,55,Vaibhav Taneja,"Yeah. I would say, you know, the special committee did an amazing job constructing this plan for the benefit of the shareholders. There's nothing which gets passed on till the time shareholders make substantial returns. That's why in the end, I would say, would urge you to not only vote on the plan but also vote on all the three directors because of their exceptional knowledge and experience. Literally, you know, we at Tesla work with these directors day in, day out. There is not even a single day that one of the directors I haven't spoken to or one of my colleagues hasn't spoken to. Even the directors out here are not just reading out of PowerPoint presentations. They're actually working with us day in, day out. Again, I just urge you guys as shareholders to vote along the board's recommendation. Thank you, guys."
a124e2bb78f2eca23ce99ee514b4c69c,56,Travis Axelrod,"Great. Thank you, Vaibhav. We appreciate everyone's questions today. We look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you very much, and goodbye."
